<br />&ldquo;Tourists Welcome&rdquo;</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It looks nice, doesn&rsquo;t it, Judy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Honey was surveying with pride the sign she
had just finished lettering. &ldquo;<span class="small">TOURISTS WELCOME</span>,&rdquo; it
said. That was all. But the sign was in the shape of
an arrow. It pointed toward the private road that
crossed Dry Brook and continued on through the
beech grove and up a little hill to the house Judy
had inherited from her grandparents. It was a simple
farmhouse with a wide front porch. Never, until
this moment, had it been known as a tourist
home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>&ldquo;It looks beautiful,&rdquo; Judy agreed. &ldquo;I wonder
who our first tourist will be. This is going to be
exciting. Wait till Peter hears&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you told him?&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s sister questioned
in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I?&rdquo; Judy laughed. &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t here
when I thought of it. I was walking through all
those spare rooms we have, and the house seemed
sort of empty. Then you came, and I thought of
asking you to letter the sign. It ought to attract
someone. There aren&rsquo;t any other tourist places
along this road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; agreed Honey, &ldquo;but isn&rsquo;t it a little&mdash;well,
dangerous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To take in tourists? Lots of people do it,&rdquo; declared
Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Honey objected, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t help
suspecting you of some secret motive. This isn&rsquo;t a
trap for an escaped federal prisoner, is it? What did
you do? Peek at the FBI files?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; Judy was indignant at the suggestion.
Like most redheads, she was quick to flare
up. But she cooled down just as quickly. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
look at them even if I wanted to,&rdquo; she now informed
Honey. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re kept at the agency in the
Farringdon courthouse. Peter is supposed to work
there instead of at home for some reason.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t be the reason, could you?&rdquo; teased
Honey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve helped him solve a few mysteries?
Why shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; Judy retorted. &ldquo;What are FBI
wives supposed to do if not help their husbands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They help them in other ways,&rdquo; Honey began.
&ldquo;They stay home and take care of their families.
They do secretarial work&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not according to Peter,&rdquo; Judy interrupted.
&ldquo;Oh, I know he calls me his secretary, but I&rsquo;m not
really in the employ of the government the way he
is. Sometimes he asks me to type reports on things
I already know about, or write a letter. As for
taking care of the family, we haven&rsquo;t any unless you
count Blackberry, and cats take care of themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do have the house&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I may as well make use of it,&rdquo; Judy
broke in. &ldquo;This may be exciting&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judy,&rdquo; Honey interrupted, &ldquo;do you see what
I see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A car with three men in it! Oh dear! I hadn&rsquo;t
counted on so many!&rdquo; Judy exclaimed as the car
came to a stop beside them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>At first both girls were dismayed. Gray eyes met
blue ones in a moment of panic. Then Honey
recognized one of the men as a customer who had
ordered signs to be lettered at the studio in Farringdon
where she worked as an artist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That one won&rsquo;t want a room,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;He lives around here. His name&rsquo;s Montrose, I
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the others?&rdquo; Judy whispered back.</p>
<p>For some reason that she could not name, she was
suddenly suspicious of them. None of the men introduced
themselves. After inquiring briefly about
the sign, they piled out of the expensive car they
were driving and asked Judy and Honey to show
them the house. The two girls started down the
road, hardly knowing what to expect. They had
crossed Dry Brook and were passing through the
beech grove when a sudden rustling of the wind in
the trees overhead made them look up. The sky
had darkened although it was still early in the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s weird,&rdquo; Judy whispered. &ldquo;See that pinkish
haze over there? It makes the sun look red. And the
wind sounds&mdash;strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is sort of spooky,&rdquo; Honey replied. &ldquo;I think a
storm is blowing up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>&ldquo;We need it,&rdquo; Judy said. &ldquo;The ground is too dry.
Maybe it&rsquo;s just dust that makes the sky look pink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pink!&rdquo; exclaimed Honey. &ldquo;It looks green in the
other direction, and I don&rsquo;t like it. There&rsquo;s something
unnatural about the weather lately. Haven&rsquo;t
you noticed it yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t thought much about it,&rdquo; replied Judy.</p>
<p>She could tell Honey was chattering because she
was nervous, and said no more. The three men
were now exploring the grove, spreading out in all
directions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That a barn over there?&rdquo; one man inquired.</p>
<p>Before Judy could answer, another of the men,
who had a white scar across his cheek, said, &ldquo;Anything
in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a saddle horse and one cow,&rdquo; Judy began.
&ldquo;We like fresh milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A stout man, the shortest of the three, chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your dad ain&rsquo;t much of a farmer, is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dad doesn&rsquo;t live here,&rdquo; Judy said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
just my husband and myself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your husband? Now you are kidding. You girls
don&rsquo;t either one of you look more than sixteen.
Who&rsquo;s this other girl if you&rsquo;re the lady of the
house?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m her sister-in-law,&rdquo; Honey said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t live
here in Dry Brook Hollow. I live in Farringdon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You work there, too, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; inquired the
man she knew as Mr. Montrose. &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you the
girl who took my order for signs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; Honey admitted. &ldquo;I lettered them, too.
But I&rsquo;m not working today, because it&rsquo;s Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. You&rsquo;re just here on a visit&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody else visit?&rdquo; one of the other men interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Judy replied a little impatiently.
&ldquo;Lots of people do. My friends, my parents, my
brother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody else today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mean tourists. Not yet. We just put up
the sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the young lady would like to show us
what she&rsquo;s advertising,&rdquo; the man Honey recognized
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly,&rdquo; Judy began, but the short,
stout man interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t secluded enough for what we want,&rdquo; he
said to the driver. &ldquo;What we had in mind was a
place in the upper price brackets, not a tourist
home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a look, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Judy had changed her mind about showing
them the house and said so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve made a mistake. My house isn&rsquo;t
for sale,&rdquo; she informed them.</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence, broken only by
the sound of the wind. It was almost moaning.
Judy had never heard it make such a strange noise
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place ain&rsquo;t ha&rsquo;nted, is it?&rdquo; the stout man
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be,&rdquo; the third man said, and Judy
couldn&rsquo;t tell whether or not he was serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can find another place farther out in
the country,&rdquo; the short man suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re headed for a town right now,&rdquo; Honey
told them. &ldquo;Roulsville is just a few miles below
here. Then comes a long stretch of state forest
land&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;National forest,&rdquo; Judy corrected her.</p>
<p>The tallest man in the group looked at her
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it make any difference?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, n-no,&rdquo; she stammered, feeling suddenly
uncomfortable under his scrutiny. &ldquo;There are both
state and national forest reserves just west of here.
I don&rsquo;t know where one ends and the other begins,
really. I didn&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy stopped abruptly. A voice that seemed to
come from the trees themselves had said, with unmistakable
urgency:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t look for it!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br />The Talking Tree</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look for what? Who said that?
Where&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy&rsquo;s voice trailed off in bewilderment. She
moved closer to Honey, whose startled expression
showed that she had heard something, too. The
men had started hurriedly toward their car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may be back,&rdquo; the driver called as they
climbed in and drove on toward Roulsville.</p>
<p>Judy gazed after them, her thoughts in a whirl.
She was a sensible girl, not easily frightened. Before
she and Peter Dobbs were married, she used to
spend part of every summer with her grandparents
in this very house. She knew every tree in the grove
of beeches where the two girls were now standing
in puzzled silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>

<p class="center">Judy&rsquo;s voice trailed off in bewilderment</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;Grandma used to tell me those trees could talk,&rdquo;
Judy said at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo; asked Honey. &ldquo;Those men didn&rsquo;t
do it. They were frightened, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did seem to be,&rdquo; agreed Judy, &ldquo;but maybe
it was a trick of some kind. I don&rsquo;t believe they
wanted rooms at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t either. They acted more as if they were
looking for something&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then the&mdash;the trees warned them not to!
That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; exclaimed Judy.</p>
<p>All of a sudden she remembered an old family
legend that when danger threatened, the trees
would sound a warning. She had laughed at the
superstition when she first heard it from her grandparents.
Later, after the old couple died and willed
the house to her, she remembered it only in her
more fanciful moments, never mentioning it to
anyone.</p>
<p>As she stood pondering, Honey put a sympathetic
arm around her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our sign accomplished something, anyway,&rdquo;
she said reassuringly. &ldquo;It gave us a mystery to
solve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same, it <i>was</i> a foolish thing to do. Let&rsquo;s
walk back to the main road and take it down before
anyone else sees it,&rdquo; Judy suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we have to,&rdquo; Honey said plaintively, &ldquo;after
all my work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we do, Honey. We&rsquo;ve invited
trouble, not tourists. How do we know those men
weren&rsquo;t criminals trying to find out something
about Peter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Judy, you said yourself there was no danger,&rdquo;
Honey protested, hurrying to keep up with
her. They had crossed Dry Brook and were climbing
the slope toward the main road where they had
posted the sign. &ldquo;One of those men was Mr.
Montrose. At least, he had signs lettered for the
Montrose Moving Company, and they&rsquo;re well
known in Farringdon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the others? Who were they and why were
they so interested in exploring our property? No, I
think that sign will have to come down. I only hope
it comes down easier than it went up. You&rsquo;ll have
to help me with it, Honey.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will. I wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Honey&rsquo;s wish was never expressed, as a two-toned
convertible the color of coffee and cream,
and rather the worse for hard use, slowed to a stop
beside them. At the wheel of the car sat Judy&rsquo;s
brother Horace, grinning like a Cheshire cat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So my sister is running a tourist camp,&rdquo; he said
to Honey, observing the sign which she and Judy
were now struggling to remove from the post
where they had nailed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need a hammer,&rdquo; Judy remarked, ignoring
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the one we were using before. We forgot
it and left it here. But where is the paint?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I thought you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd,&rdquo; declared Judy. &ldquo;It really looks as
if someone&rsquo;s stolen it. I&rsquo;m glad they left the hammer,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; asked Horace, &ldquo;are you trying to do?
I suppose I&rsquo;ll find you building a little row of cottages
next. If you&rsquo;re going to take in tourists it
wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea. Cottages would look quite
cozy nestled in among the trees in the haunted
grove.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you call it that?&rdquo; demanded Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The name just came back to me,&rdquo; Horace
laughed. &ldquo;Grandpa called it that, and he told me
once that the trees talked. I heard them myself
when I was just a little fellow. It scared me nearly
out of my wits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It scared quite a lot of us today,&rdquo; said Honey.</p>
<p>Judy nudged her to keep quiet, but it was too
late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to tell me the trees still talk!&rdquo;
Horace exclaimed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s news! If we can find
out why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t mean to tell you anything we don&rsquo;t
wish to see printed in the <i>Farringdon Daily
Herald</i>,&rdquo; Judy interrupted. &ldquo;The story would
look pretty ridiculous, anyway, without an explanation.
&lsquo;<span class="small">TREES TALK. SCARE TOURISTS AWAY.</span>&rsquo; Seriously,&rdquo;
she continued, &ldquo;some rather peculiar tourists
did stop here. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re taking down
the sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; Horace said. &ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t want
them to stop, why did you put the sign up in the
first place?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;We did, only we didn&rsquo;t. Oh, bother!&rdquo; Judy
exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not explaining anything, am I?
It&rsquo;s a good thing you don&rsquo;t write the way I talk. By
the way, did the <i>Herald&rsquo;s</i> star reporter bring along
a copy of today&rsquo;s paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sitting on it,&rdquo; giggled Honey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; exclaimed Horace as Judy pulled the
paper out from under him and then seated herself
at his side to read it. &ldquo;That news is hot off the press.
I might have burned myself. It was my own story
I was messing up, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy glanced at the headlines&mdash;THIEVES
LOOT MILLIONAIRE&rsquo;S HOME&mdash;and quickly
read Horace&rsquo;s story about the mysterious looting of
a secluded old mansion not far from the national
forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The national forest!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Honey,
do you remember the look that man gave me when
I mentioned it? The other men acted funny, too.
Maybe <i>they</i> were the thieves. Horace, could they
have been escaping over this road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d still be around. The
robbery was pulled Thursday night, and this is
Saturday,&rdquo; Horace replied. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the remotest
idea what men you&rsquo;re talking about, though.
Everything I know about the robbery is right there
in the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see it is. It has your by-line on it. Where did
you get your information, Horace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the police and other sources,&rdquo; he replied
a little vaguely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to interview the caretaker
of the estate, even though the police have already.
That robbery was carefully planned. He may have
had a hand in it. What do you think, Judy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what
to think!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br />A Puzzling Robbery</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Honey, see what you make of it,&rdquo; said Judy,
and handed her the paper. &ldquo;You say in the <i>Herald</i>,
Horace, that the caretaker swears no one passed
his cottage on Dark Hill Road for two days. Is it a
private road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But the police think the
robbers could have sneaked in from the national
forest which borders the estate. But the forest
rangers keep pretty close watch of anyone who
enters it. They have to now, with the weather so
dry and windy. A forest fire would get out of control
fast.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some of them are already out of control, aren&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo; asked Honey. &ldquo;I saw something about it on
the back of the paper while Judy was reading the
front.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; laughed Horace. &ldquo;Now I know where
to put the news I want peeping females to see. Perhaps
the Woman&rsquo;s Page should be the back page so
that hubby can enjoy the headlines while wifey
ponders the recipes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking from wifey&rsquo;s point of view,&rdquo; Judy
retorted, &ldquo;she is just as interested in the headlines as
he is. She might even want to know the story behind
them. You&rsquo;ve only told half of it, Horace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The paper had to go to press. Papers do, you
know,&rdquo; Horace reminded her. &ldquo;The other half of
the story is probably happening right now. This
forest fire on the back page was spreading. It may
get around to the front page. It may even get as far
as the Paul Riker estate, where the robbery took
place. I&rsquo;ve never seen the main house, but I&rsquo;ve been
told it&rsquo;s an immense wooden structure with a cupola
on top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like some of the mansions in Farringdon?&rdquo;
asked Honey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt. They were all built around 1880 and
if you ask me they weren&rsquo;t beautiful, even then.
Most of them ought to be torn down. They&rsquo;re
regular firetraps besides being so hideous that nobody
wants to live in them. Modern houses like the
new ones going up in Roulsville are more to my
taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine, too,&rdquo; Honey whispered, and a look
passed between them that made Judy wonder if
Honey might not be forgetting her employer&rsquo;s
handsome young son for Judy&rsquo;s own not so handsome
but lovable brother.</p>
<p>Honey was having a hard time choosing between
her two suitors and seemed in no great hurry to
make up her mind. Judy knew how it was. She had
once faced the same problem. If she had married
handsome Arthur Farringdon-Pett instead of Peter
Dobbs, her home might have been one of the mansions
they were talking about. Judy did not consider
them hideous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like old houses,&rdquo; she told her brother. &ldquo;I guess
Grandma knew it when she left me her house and
gave you the land. You can build your modern
house on it whenever you&rsquo;re ready. I like all houses,
both old and new, if they&rsquo;re real homes and not
built just for show.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Riker mansion used to be called a show-place.
I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know who would look at it
way back there in the woods,&rdquo; Horace said, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;m told that before the robbery it was filled with
art treasures, including a world-famous collection
of jade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A museum of Oriental art, according to your
article,&rdquo; quoted Judy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the sense of
keeping such valuable things in a private home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For once,&rdquo; Horace said, &ldquo;we agree on something.
Paul Riker needed a flock of servants just to
take care of all the stuff he collected. The police
estimate the loot as being worth a quarter of a
million dollars and maybe more. An actual evaluation
can&rsquo;t be made until Mr. Riker returns from his
travels. The police are trying to get in touch with
him, but nobody seems to know where he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must have made it convenient for the robbers,&rdquo;
Judy commented. &ldquo;Do you really think the
caretaker might be involved?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to talk with him before I know what
to think,&rdquo; replied Horace. &ldquo;How would you girls
like to drive out there with me this afternoon?
We might pick up a few clues, maybe run into
Peter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s investigating it,&rdquo; Judy interrupted, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think we should. I&rsquo;ve dashed off after him
before&mdash;to my sorrow. Once a bullet barely missed
me, and he made me promise not to run headlong
into danger again. Besides, the kids are coming here
today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kids?&rdquo; Honey asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember them,&rdquo; Judy said. &ldquo;They used to
call themselves the Junior FBI. They meet here
every Saturday. Peter suggested that they change
their name. He&rsquo;s afraid they&rsquo;ll get themselves involved
in something dangerous. I think he&rsquo;s wrong,
though. The club doesn&rsquo;t get them into trouble. It
keeps them out of it. Their latest project is a magic
show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magic! That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; exclaimed Honey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The voice from the tree. It must have been one
of their tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; Horace objected. &ldquo;I heard the talking
trees before some of those kids were born.
Grandpa used to call it a freak of nature. I always
meant to investigate it, but never got around to it.
Maybe it&rsquo;s an echo thrown back from the barn.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;We could find out easily enough by standing
opposite the barn and calling,&rdquo; Judy suggested
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t we feel a little foolish, Judy?&rdquo; asked
Honey, holding back a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Judy declared. &ldquo;Come on! I&rsquo;d like
to try it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br />A Startling Experiment</h2>
<p>The driveway, or Little Road, as Judy called it,
went down a steep slope from the main road. Then
it crossed Dry Brook, went through the grove and
up another slope, where it took a half-turn, like a
half-circle, in front of the house and ended at the
barn. Horace stopped his car on the downward
slope and they all got out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here we are opposite the barn. Now for
the experiment. Who wants to yell?&rdquo; Judy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all do it together,&rdquo; Honey suggested.
&ldquo;Do you remember our old school yell?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Boom ta! Boom ta! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p class="t0">Farringdon Girls&rsquo; High School, give us room!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Honey, let&rsquo;s not give that one,&rdquo; Judy objected.
&ldquo;It always makes me think of when the old
high school burned down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a better one at Boys&rsquo; High&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a still better one back in Roulsville before
the flood,&rdquo; Judy interrupted. &ldquo;Horace, do you
remember how it went? It meant, &lsquo;<i>This is where
we&rsquo;re hiding</i>,&rsquo; and if you tried hard you could pick
the word <i>hiding</i> out of the jumble of nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t decode it. I just yelled it,&rdquo; Horace
chuckled. &ldquo;<i>Hip deminiga folliga sock de hump de
lolliga yoo hoo!</i>&rdquo; he yelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; Honey said, holding her ears.</p>
<p>But Judy was listening for the echo. It was a very
ordinary one, not half as startling as the yell itself.
Horace suggested they try it from a different angle,
but just then Judy&rsquo;s cat Blackberry appeared from
around the corner of the barn and yowled, as if he
were trying to say, &ldquo;Please, people, don&rsquo;t scare
away my mice!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>The chickens were cackling, and even Ginger, in
a far corner of the pasture, gave a startled whinny.
Daisy, munching grass a little nearer by, looked up
in the docile manner of cows and continued to regard
Judy with a disconcerting stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really think,&rdquo; Honey said when their
laughter had subsided, &ldquo;that we ought to try that
yell again. I hope it didn&rsquo;t curdle Daisy&rsquo;s milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She reminded me of you, sis, the way she ignored
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that I won&rsquo;t take, being compared to a
cow,&rdquo; cried Judy as she went for Horace.</p>
<p>They chased each other as far as the big barn
door where they stopped to read the sign that was
posted there.</p>
<p class="center">HEADQUARTERS OF THE BLACK SPOT
<br /><i>Moved to Wally&rsquo;s house. Meeting at 2 o&rsquo;clock</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve solved one mystery, at least,&rdquo; Horace
said as Honey came closer to admire the lettering.
&ldquo;Now you know what became of your left-over
paint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ricky must have borrowed it. He&rsquo;s the new
president of the Junior FBI&mdash;excuse me, I mean
the Black Spot,&rdquo; declared Judy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
I like their new name. I wonder who dreamed up
that one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;Blackberry doesn&rsquo;t seem to care for it, either,&rdquo;
observed Honey. &ldquo;Just look at the way he&rsquo;s acting.
What&rsquo;s the matter with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cat was circling around them as if he wanted
to tell them something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I take him with us in the car?&rdquo; asked
Horace. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to stay home for the
children if they&rsquo;re meeting somewhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Judy admitted. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell them,
but I planned refreshments. Now we&rsquo;ll have all that
left-over food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pity!&rdquo; Horace said, smacking his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just cookies and chocolate milk. Hardly
a treat for anyone with your appetite,&rdquo; Judy told
him. &ldquo;The children may be back, anyway, in case
Wally&rsquo;s mother doesn&rsquo;t approve of their plan. Most
of the mothers didn&rsquo;t want the meetings in their
immaculate new houses. That&rsquo;s why I told them
they could meet in our barn. I like having them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were you,&rdquo; Honey said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like having
them somewhere else this afternoon. If we&rsquo;re looking
for whatever we weren&rsquo;t supposed to look
for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of double-talk is this?&rdquo; Horace interrupted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, didn&rsquo;t we tell you?&rdquo; Judy knew she hadn&rsquo;t,
but she was still tempted, at times, to tease her
brother. It was sort of a game between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told me very little,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You
were afraid I&rsquo;d get a story out of it, but never fear!
We&rsquo;ve printed enough of that spooky stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was spooky, all right,&rdquo; Judy said with a
shiver. &ldquo;The trees warned us or the men, I&rsquo;m not
sure which, not to look for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Honey pointed out, &ldquo;since we have
no idea what <i>it</i> is, the whole thing is rather hard to
explain. But you should know, Horace. You said
you heard the trees talk before. What did they say?
Can you remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought about it for a minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve forgotten a lot of it, but once they told me
to keep still, and I didn&rsquo;t dare open my mouth all
day. They really frightened me. I was something of
a sissy then,&rdquo; he confessed, &ldquo;but Judy cured me of
it. I didn&rsquo;t tell her anything about it when it happened,
for fear she would laugh at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see what a meanie I was?&rdquo; Judy asked.
&ldquo;Where were you, Horace? I mean when you
heard all this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember exactly. There was a hollow
tree not far from where I was standing, and the
voice seemed to come from there. The hole in the
tree was small. I remember thinking how much it
looked like an open mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that tree. I used to use the hole to get
a toehold when I climbed it. You can see the top of
it from here. It&rsquo;s that big spreading tree beyond
the barn. Unless it was an echo,&rdquo; Judy went on in
a puzzled tone, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how it could have happened&mdash;unless
a radio or something of the kind was
hidden there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there was nothing,&rdquo; Horace said. &ldquo;I got up
courage enough to look. Nothing larger than a doll
could have squeezed inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of my dolls, maybe. I used to play with
them in the grove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your dolls didn&rsquo;t talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pretended they did. All little girls pretend
their dolls can talk,&rdquo; declared Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Honey said. &ldquo;I never played with
dolls. But then I didn&rsquo;t grow up in my own home
the way you and Horace did. I try not to remember
my childhood.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Judy gave the friend and sister she
had found a quick kiss. Then, suddenly, Honey remembered
something else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That tourist sign!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;We never
took it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late,&rdquo; Horace commented as a small voice
spoke almost at his elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;may we stay here for the
night?&rdquo;</p>

<br />An Urgent Request</h2>
<p>Judy whirled around to see a tiny girl with short
brown curls and an older boy who might be her
brother. Both of them were out of breath, as if they
had been running. It was the boy who had spoken.
But now the little girl asked, &ldquo;Were you talking
about a doll?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were we, Honey?&rdquo; Judy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly were,&rdquo; Honey replied. &ldquo;Yours,
when you were little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I thought&mdash;&rdquo; the little girl began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit thinking about it, Penny. It won&rsquo;t help,&rdquo;
the boy interrupted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Judy asked the children. &ldquo;And
where did you come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Paul and she&rsquo;s Penny. We came from the
car,&rdquo; the boy explained. &ldquo;Mom can&rsquo;t get it started.
She needs someone to push her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m her man,&rdquo; Horace said.</p>
<p>He turned his car around and invited the children
to come with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we have to?&rdquo; Penny asked shyly. &ldquo;I want to
stay here and play. I&rsquo;m tired of riding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, too. You&rsquo;ll find Mom all right. Our car&rsquo;s
stalled just a little way beyond your sign. It&rsquo;s an
old beat-up green car,&rdquo; Paul explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he can start it,&rdquo; the little boy said as
Horace drove off to assist his mother. &ldquo;We were
on our way to Uncle Paul&rsquo;s house. We expected to
get there this afternoon, but Mom says she&rsquo;s so
tired she can&rsquo;t drive another mile. That&rsquo;s why I
asked if we could stay overnight. Mom said maybe
you would let us stay until she figures out what to
do next. We saw your sign just before we had the
accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accident!&rdquo; exclaimed Judy and Honey in one
breath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we were sort of shoved off the road,&rdquo;
Paul told them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did it on purpose,&rdquo; the little girl said.
&ldquo;Then they emptied out all our suitcases and went
off with Mommy&rsquo;s pocketbook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep still about that, Penny!&rdquo; the boy said
severely. &ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t supposed to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she had the green doll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this, the boy clapped his hand over his sister&rsquo;s
mouth with such violence that the child began to
cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have done that. You&rsquo;ve hurt
her!&rdquo; cried Honey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She talks too much,&rdquo; was the boy&rsquo;s brief explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like little girls who talk too much,&rdquo; Judy said,
taking Penny to a more secluded part of the grove
to comfort her and find out what the real trouble
was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paul didn&rsquo;t mean it,&rdquo; Penny defended her
brother. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just scared, and so is Mommy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think she would be! Are you sure those
men caused the accident on purpose to steal her
pocketbook?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center">The boy clapped his hand over his sister&rsquo;s mouth</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;No-o,&rdquo; the little girl said slowly. &ldquo;They wanted
something else. They talked as if they&rsquo;d been to
Uncle Paul&rsquo;s house looking for it and couldn&rsquo;t
find it. It was a&mdash;a <i>correction</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A correction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it&rsquo;s a secret. I mustn&rsquo;t tell anyone about
it because it will get us into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why are you telling me?&rdquo; asked Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; Penny explained quickly, &ldquo;you get
into trouble sometimes when you don&rsquo;t tell things.
Mommy did. I&rsquo;d never, never steal anything after
what she told me. Only bad people steal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Judy.</p>
<p>Maybe she had agreed too quickly. Her answer
seemed to disturb the little girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; Penny said, &ldquo;when you&rsquo;re little,
you make mistakes. That&rsquo;s different, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite different,&rdquo; agreed Judy, wondering what
all this was leading up to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Penny asked unexpectedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose it&rsquo;s because you can learn from
your mistakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What mistake was Penny talking about?&rdquo; asked
Paul.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>He had been exploring the grove with Honey,
who had discovered the hollow tree and pointed
out the hole that looked like an open mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know,&rdquo; Judy confessed. &ldquo;Your
little sister didn&rsquo;t make herself very clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She hadn&rsquo;t better,&rdquo; Paul said threateningly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
never tell her any of my secrets after this. What
made you spill all that about Mom&rsquo;s pocketbook,
Penny? Those kids said they&rsquo;d trail the thieves and
make them give it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Penny said. &ldquo;They let the
robbers get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can pick up their trail again if you
will tell us about it,&rdquo; Judy suggested. &ldquo;Were the
thieves in a car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Paul replied. &ldquo;They came alongside and
crowded Mom off the road. She got out to see how
much damage she&rsquo;d done when she hit the bank.
That was when they pointed the gun at her and
went through all our luggage. They didn&rsquo;t take
anything except her pocketbook. They grabbed it
and ran back to their car and drove away. If we
can&rsquo;t get our car started I guess we&rsquo;ll have to stay
here. Uncle Paul will pay for us. He has lots of
money,&rdquo; the boy finished proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your uncle&rsquo;s whole name, Paul?&rdquo; asked
Judy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s my great-uncle really. It&rsquo;s Paul Riker, the
same as mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man who was robbed! I remember
it from the newspaper account,&rdquo; Judy whispered
excitedly to Honey. &ldquo;Wait till Horace hears about
this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like it here,&rdquo; announced Penny. &ldquo;Do you allow
children to climb the trees?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re careful&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they were both off to the hollow tree. Paul
started at once to climb it, but Judy saw Penny
stop and put her hand inside the hollow place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s she found?&rdquo; Honey whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she&rsquo;s discovered the secret of the voice,&rdquo;
Judy whispered back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Penny cried as they both came over to
see. &ldquo;Is this a fairy bed? Do you think fairies live in
here? I heard them whispering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear what they said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, just whispers.&rdquo; Penny turned a solemn
little face to Judy. &ldquo;Did you hear them, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fairies? Perhaps,&rdquo; Judy said thoughtfully.
&ldquo;What have you in your hand, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Penny was glad to show her. It was a soft little
cushion of moss she had picked from inside the
tree. There was nothing else to be found in the
hollow except bits of decayed wood. Judy put her
hand in to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you feel anything?&rdquo; asked Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the moss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it soft?&rdquo; the little girl said, stroking the
piece she was holding. &ldquo;You can pet it like a kitten.
It&rsquo;s a pretty green, too&mdash;almost the color of the
doll. Please, will you help us find it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br />An Empty Pocketbook</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look for it!&rdquo; the voice from the tree had
said. And now a request, equally urgent, had come
from a real live little girl: &ldquo;Please, will you help us
find it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the strange warning flashed through
Judy&rsquo;s mind. Just what it was she was supposed to
find&mdash;or not to find&mdash;still puzzled her. But she had
found the explanation for unearthly things before
and could do it again. A little uneasily, she replied
that she would do what she could.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>It was hard to get a description of the doll. All
Penny could tell her was that its hair, its face&mdash;everything
about it&mdash;was green.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Its clothes, too?&rdquo; Honey asked.</p>
<p>Penny nodded solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, everything. It came from the Land of Oz,
I think. My mother read me the story once. Everything
was green there, too, and she was a princess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your doll?&rdquo; asked Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t <i>my</i> doll. Sometimes Mommy would
let me look at her. She told me her name, too, but
I&rsquo;ve forgotten it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it Dorothy?&rdquo; questioned Honey.</p>
<p>Penny shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ozma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that isn&rsquo;t right, either. Mommy knows it,
but you mustn&rsquo;t tell her I told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t say a word, will we, Judy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that your name?&rdquo; asked the little girl. &ldquo;Mine&rsquo;s
Penelope, but people call me Penny for short. May
I call you Judy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you may both call me Judy,&rdquo; she replied as
Paul descended from the tree. &ldquo;This is Grace
Dobbs, but I named her Honey before I knew who
she was. Now we&rsquo;re sisters&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s eyes widened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;Real sisters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I married Honey&rsquo;s brother Peter. My
brother is Horace&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he comes now with the children&rsquo;s
mother,&rdquo; Honey interrupted as the convertible
came roaring down the road and stopped almost
beside them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back so soon?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;The children were
telling me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t tell her anything,&rdquo; Paul protested,
looking frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The children only said you&rsquo;ve been having
trouble, Mrs. Riker,&rdquo; Judy explained. &ldquo;I hope we
can be of some help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very kind,&rdquo; the woman sitting beside
Horace said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid nobody can help me
very much. I did have plans, but now everything
has changed. I&rsquo;m so nervous and upset, I don&rsquo;t even
want to talk about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t talk about it until you&rsquo;re rested.
Come into the house,&rdquo; Judy offered, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll make
you a cup of hot tea. There are cookies and chocolate
milk for the children&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear that, Penny?&rdquo; asked Paul. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
race you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>They were off before their mother could stop
them. On the porch they found Blackberry and
called back to Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this your cat? Is it all right if we pet him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask Blackberry. He&rsquo;s the one to decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He likes us,&rdquo; Paul announced as the others came
up onto the porch. They were just in time, as it
was beginning to rain. Mrs. Riker hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure we ought to accept your hospitality,&rdquo;
she said to Judy. &ldquo;You see, I can&rsquo;t pay for the
rooms until later. My pocketbook was stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. The children told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny did,&rdquo; Paul put in quickly. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t
going to say anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;m glad you understand. I&rsquo;m
not going to report the theft and I&rsquo;d appreciate it
if you wouldn&rsquo;t mention it, either. I don&rsquo;t want any
more trouble&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mommy, you said&mdash;&rdquo; Penny began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, <i>will</i> you keep still?&rdquo; her brother exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her go on. This interests me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently Horace was hearing about the stolen
pocketbook for the first time. Judy smiled and invited
everybody in. Blackberry politely refused.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;There he goes, off toward the barn!&rdquo; Paul exclaimed.
&ldquo;Come on, Penny! Let&rsquo;s follow him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Judy had an idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honey, will you take Mrs. Riker inside?&rdquo; she
asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see what Blackberry&rsquo;s up to. He&rsquo;s
helped us solve mysteries before. There must be
something in the barn he wants to show us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mice, probably. But go ahead,&rdquo; Honey told her.
&ldquo;I know where everything is. I&rsquo;ll have refreshments
ready for the rest of us by the time you get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy intended to take only a few minutes. But
when they reached the barn Penny and Paul
wanted to climb to the hayloft. There they found
three of the club members, two girls and a boy, apparently
searching for something in the hay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, there!&rdquo; Judy greeted them. &ldquo;Be careful,
Black Spots, or someone will rub you out. And if
you&rsquo;ve lost anything, don&rsquo;t look for it. We&rsquo;ve been
warned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ricky, the club president, looked at her with a
baffled expression on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are joking?&rdquo; he said in what Judy considered
a charming accent. &ldquo;The Americans make
the jokes I do not understand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;There was a big fight,&rdquo; spoke up Muriel Blade.
&ldquo;The rest of the kids went to Wally&rsquo;s house, but
Anne and me, we stuck by Ricky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne, the youngest of the club members, was
solemnly regarding the two Riker children. She
was standing in a shaft of light that came in through
a small window overlooking the grove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know them,&rdquo; she told Judy. &ldquo;We tried to
trail the bad men for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see the men&rsquo;s faces?&rdquo; asked Judy.
&ldquo;What did they look like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Interrupting each other as they talked, the children
quickly described them. The descriptions
fitted. There had been three men, and one of them
had a long scar right across his cheek. Paul was certain
they were right about that, because he remembered
that it had been the scar-faced man who held
the gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find out where they went?&rdquo; Paul asked
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Ricky admitted. &ldquo;But we did find this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mom&rsquo;s pocketbook!&rdquo; yelled both the Riker
children as he held it up. &ldquo;How did you get it
back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was easy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They threw it away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ricky found it in the road,&rdquo; Anne put in,
and Muriel hastily added, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s empty. They took
out everything that was in it except a lipstick and
handkerchief. Oh, yes, and an empty box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure it&rsquo;s empty?&rdquo; asked Penny, reaching
for the small blue box they had found in her
mother&rsquo;s pocketbook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite sure,&rdquo; Muriel said. &ldquo;We just looked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Penny exclaimed with a disappointed little
sigh. &ldquo;That was the box&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped at a look from Paul, but Judy almost
knew she had been about to say it was the box that
had held the green doll. At least, Judy knew now
how big it was. Or rather, how small. The box was
only about four inches long. Inside was a soft lining
of satin and an impression as if something had rested
there a long time without being disturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on the trail of it now, whatever it is,&rdquo;
Judy thought.</p>
<p>Aloud she asked, &ldquo;Is anybody hungry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re starved!&rdquo; yelled the children in a resounding
chorus.</p>
<p>A moment later they were following Judy down
the ladder from the hayloft. Outside it was raining
harder than ever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on then, back to the house!&rdquo; she called.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have refreshments just the way I planned,
but we&rsquo;ll have to make a dash for them through the
rain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br />More Puzzles</h2>
<p>Judy was halfway to the house with the excited
children when they bumped into Horace, who had
been out on some mysterious errand of his own. He
grinned at them as if he knew a secret. Like Judy
and the children, he had been caught in the sudden
downpour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come in! Come in!&rdquo; Honey invited them. She
led them through the living room and into Judy&rsquo;s
spacious kitchen which served as a dining room as
well. &ldquo;Join Blackberry and dry yourselves before
the fire. He didn&rsquo;t wait for an invitation. He
scooted in ahead of you. Everything&rsquo;s ready,&rdquo; she
announced. &ldquo;Judy made the cookies herself. Try
one. They&rsquo;re delicious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Riker seemed more willing to talk and
joined the children around the table in the kitchen.
She could not help exclaiming over the beauty of
the room with its huge stone fireplace and beamed
ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It reminds me of our kitchen when I was a little
girl,&rdquo; she told the children. &ldquo;I did want you to see
it, but now I don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can help,&rdquo; Judy offered again.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Riker protested that she had been too
kind already.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deserve anybody&rsquo;s kindness,&rdquo; she added.
&ldquo;My troubles are all my own fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; Judy objected. &ldquo;If your
pocketbook was stolen from you I would say the
thieves were to blame. Do you mind if I tell
Peter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your husband?&rdquo; Mrs. Riker inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We help him solve mysteries,&rdquo; Ricky began,
but at a look from Judy, he suddenly fell silent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, instead of helping to solve them,
you&rsquo;re making them today,&rdquo; declared Horace.
&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t hear any trees talking, did you, Ricky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; Ricky asked in surprise. &ldquo;You are making
jokes again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel turned to Horace wide-eyed through the
glasses that always seemed too large for her small
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard the trees talking,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t
going to say anything about it, because I didn&rsquo;t
think you&rsquo;d believe me. They told us to run&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; little Anne put in solemnly, &ldquo;we
ran back along the shortcut and Ricky caught up
with us, and all three of us met Penny and Paul and
ran after the bad men. Is the magician one of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew,&rdquo; declared Judy. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
whole lot I wish I knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to meet him,&rdquo; Anne finished. &ldquo;He
can make things disappear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So can I,&rdquo; Horace chuckled, helping himself
to another cookie.</p>
<p>He passed the cookies around and they rapidly
disappeared from the plate. Afterwards there was
silence. Each one seemed busy with his own
thoughts, even Blackberry on his rug before the
fireplace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Judy liked her big kitchen. It was a good place
for thoughts. Usually they were pleasant ones inspired
by the view from the picture window. Judy
had placed the table in front of it so that she and
Peter could look out on the trees that bordered Dry
Brook while they were eating. They had been
lovely in the summer and early fall. But now with
the rain beating against the bare branches, there
was something eerie about them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trees are still whispering,&rdquo; Penny said to
Anne, whose other name turned out to be Black.
It seemed a misnomer to Judy since Anne was a
tiny blonde. The little girl shivered as she watched
the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that big one with its arms spread out
over the barn. It scares me,&rdquo; she confided to Penny.
&ldquo;That was the tree that told us to run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did it tell you?&rdquo; asked Horace, overhearing
Anne&rsquo;s remark.</p>
<p>He had what Judy called that &ldquo;eager beaver&rdquo;
look in his eye. &ldquo;I may as well warn you, Mrs.
Riker,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that my brother is a newspaper
reporter. He&rsquo;s good at finding out things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>I</i> may as well warn you,&rdquo; Horace retorted,
&ldquo;that my sister is known as quite a detective. She&rsquo;s
good at finding out things, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;Secrets?&rdquo; asked Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be surprised,&rdquo; Honey said with a reassuring
smile, for the little girl seemed suddenly
frightened, &ldquo;how many she&rsquo;s kept and is still keeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than even you know,&rdquo; declared Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you keeping a secret about the talking
trees?&rdquo; asked Muriel. &ldquo;Was it the magician? Magicians
can do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it a trick, Horace?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;Ventriloquism,
maybe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought he might have guessed the answer.
But he only shook his head and said, &ldquo;A trick of
the wind, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could have been magic,&rdquo; Muriel insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could have been anything!&rdquo; exclaimed
Honey, giving up. &ldquo;A magic trick or the wind or
fairies or the voice of a doll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one we&rsquo;re supposed to find!&rdquo; Judy broke
in excitedly, forgetting her promise of secrecy.
&ldquo;That may be it, Honey! If we find the doll we
may find out what the voice is, too. May I tell Peter
about it?&rdquo; she whispered to Penny. &ldquo;He may be
able to help us find it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;Find what? I didn&rsquo;t tell you anything,&rdquo; the
little girl said loud enough for the others to hear.
&ldquo;I was just making it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course she was,&rdquo; Paul agreed. &ldquo;Penny is
always making up things. Who ever heard of a
green doll?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>

<br />The Wonders of Magic</h2>
<p>Judy didn&rsquo;t for a minute believe Penny had made
up the story she had told her. The empty box
proved there had been something of value in her
mother&rsquo;s pocketbook. But it was obvious the little
girl was afraid to talk about it except when she and
Judy were alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Judy asked herself. &ldquo;What is she afraid
of?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>The trees were frightening, but Penny claimed
she had heard nothing but whispers from them.
Had a voice really told Muriel and Anne to run?
Judy questioned them some more, and they still
insisted the voice had come right out of that hollow
tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has a mouth,&rdquo; Muriel said, &ldquo;and arms that it
waves in the wind. It&rsquo;s alive, Judy. We&rsquo;re afraid to
go home for fear it will catch us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I would like to see,&rdquo; declared Horace, and
everybody laughed.</p>
<p>But Muriel really believed the magician had been
there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to be at Wally&rsquo;s house. He could
make a tree talk if he wanted to,&rdquo; she insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he could trick you into thinking he
could,&rdquo; Horace admitted. &ldquo;Somebody is playing
tricks, that&rsquo;s for certain. It may be this magician.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of him,&rdquo; Anne confessed. &ldquo;Wally
says he will pick me to disappear because I&rsquo;m the
littlest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be if I join the club,&rdquo; Penny spoke
up. &ldquo;Could I, Mommy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Who is this magician?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know his name,&rdquo; Ricky said. &ldquo;Even
Wally doesn&rsquo;t know it. The Dran boys will introduce
him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to do tricks for us if we sell enough
tickets,&rdquo; Muriel put in. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to sell them.
Wally said I couldn&rsquo;t keep the money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. It goes into the club treasury,
probably. By the way, who is the treasurer?&rdquo; Horace
wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; Muriel said with a pout, &ldquo;but they&rsquo;re
going to have an election, so I guess I won&rsquo;t be any
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today?&rdquo; asked Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I won&rsquo;t go. Wally said they&rsquo;d elect all
new officers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; Horace stopped her. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t
all up to Wally. If this is an election they&rsquo;ll need
your votes. I think you kids are making a big mistake.
You ought to be at that meeting. I&rsquo;ll take you
there if you say the word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we go too?&rdquo; asked Penny.</p>
<p>Paul objected before their mother could answer.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather go on to Uncle Paul&rsquo;s house this afternoon,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Is the car fixed, Mom? Can&rsquo;t we
get started?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at Horace and both of them sighed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in a garage in Roulsville,&rdquo; Horace said. &ldquo;I
had to push it all the way there. I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s
pretty much of a mess. But I leave the whole problem
to you, Judy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Judy, &ldquo;you want to interview the
caretaker, Horace. Penny wants to attend the election
and Mrs. Riker and Paul want to visit her
uncle. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be simpler if we just went to
all three places and killed two birds with one stone?
Or do I mean three birds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say, Mrs. Riker?&rdquo; Horace asked.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t very much Mrs. Riker could say
except yes, and yet she hesitated as if she dreaded
the visit and wished to put it off as long as she could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let your great-uncle Paul frighten you,&rdquo;
she warned the children. &ldquo;Remember, he&rsquo;s used to
having his own way. You must do whatever he
says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will!&rdquo; they chorused.</p>
<p>Blackberry wanted to go along. He had a favorite
spot on top of the back seat by the rear window
of Peter&rsquo;s car. Now he found a similar place in
Horace&rsquo;s convertible, and the children scrambled in
after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This car needs a good washing. The rain won&rsquo;t
stop us,&rdquo; Horace announced cheerfully as they
started off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>He seemed a little too cheerful, but Judy knew
his motives. More than ever now he wanted to get
the other half of the robbery story. Nobody had
mentioned it to Mrs. Riker. Unless she had seen a
paper or heard the news on the radio, she still didn&rsquo;t
know that in the absence of the uncle she was
about to visit, he had been robbed of valuable art
treasures. Why hadn&rsquo;t Horace told her about it,
Judy wondered. Did he think he would find out
more if he kept quiet? If those men had questioned
her before the robbery it might make sense. But
afterwards&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The magician could have been one of those
men who stopped here,&rdquo; she said aloud, as Horace
pulled up to remove the sign from the post by the
main road. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to meet him and find out for
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have the opportunity very soon,&rdquo;
Horace said as he gave the sign a last tug and then
threw it in the rear compartment of his car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; Honey warned him. &ldquo;The paint
isn&rsquo;t dry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither am I,&rdquo; he complained as he returned to
the driver&rsquo;s seat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Soon they reached the home of Wally Brown, a
chubby blond boy who showed them to the downstairs
recreation room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The magician is here to pick the children he
wants in his act. Would you kids like to meet him?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>Honey and Mrs. Riker had remained in the car,
but Penny and Paul had come in with Judy and
Horace. Their yes was so enthusiastic that Judy
held her ears. The club members were in time for
the election. The first part of the meeting, Wally
explained, had been taken up with plans for the
magic show.</p>
<p>Soon they were all under the magician&rsquo;s spell.
They had been asked to close their eyes and make
a wish just before he appeared on the stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close your eyes quick,&rdquo; a strange little girl
whispered to Penny. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to make our
wishes come true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently the magician stood before them on a
stage that was still in the process of being constructed.
He was quite an ordinary-looking man,
but there was something about his voice that
seemed to give him authority.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have you all made your wishes?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;Perhaps I can&rsquo;t make all of them come true, but I
shall certainly do my best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make mine come true now, please, Mr. Magician,
because we have to go,&rdquo; Penny pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open your eyes, little girl. All of you open
your eyes. Did I forget to tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several children laughed, but Penny let out a
startled and long-drawn-out &ldquo;Ooooo!&rdquo; as her eyes
snapped open.</p>
<p>The children were crowding so close, Judy
couldn&rsquo;t see what trick the magician was doing.
But he was not one of the men she had seen in the
car. She doubted if she had ever seen him before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, children!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Your
mother and Honey are waiting in the car. We all
want to get started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny backed out, unable to take her eyes away
from the stage. One of the boys had wished for a
puppy, and the magician was pulling it right out of
a hat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>Penny and Paul stared at him as if he had performed
a miracle instead of a simple magic trick.
Whispers of, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s magic all right. He can bring
anything to life,&rdquo; went on between them. When
they were back in the car the children told their
mother Muriel was right. Magicians could do anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a house I intend to haunt,&rdquo; announced
Horace as they drove away. &ldquo;Maybe I can give
their magic show a little publicity. There&rsquo;s room
down there for quite a crowd and I certainly intend
to be in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; declared Judy. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t miss it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about us?&rdquo; asked Penny and Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; their mother promised.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br />A Strange Mistake</h2>
<p>Excited squeals and whispers came from the
back seat. Everything was suddenly magic, even
the rain. It was really coming down now. The children
could hardly see the ruins of the big dam as
they passed it. Judy said something about it, but
they were no longer interested in anything but the
magic that now had them in its spell.</p>
<p>Judy and Mrs. Riker and the children were all
in the back seat. It had grown a little uncomfortable
with Penny and Paul bouncing from one window
to the other and finding magic in everything.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Both children now took it for granted that the
magician had made the trees talk. The matter was
all settled in their minds, but not in Judy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two kinds of magic,&rdquo; she told them.
&ldquo;I like the natural kind best. Even that voice you&rsquo;re
talking about could have been the wind. Sometimes
it does make a funny moaning noise when the
trees are bare and the branches swing against each
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Judy, you know it wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Honey objected
from her place in front beside Horace. &ldquo;The
wind wasn&rsquo;t blowing as hard as it is now, and these
trees aren&rsquo;t talking&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they aren&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Horace commented as if the
whole thing was nothing but a big joke.</p>
<p>They were driving through a thickly wooded
section. A rabbit ran across the road, and the children
squealed and nearly let Blackberry leap out
of the car after it. Then Paul said something about
how clever the magician had been to make a puppy
jump out of his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get my wish yet,&rdquo; Paul added, &ldquo;but I
can wait for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got mine,&rdquo; Penny whispered, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not
telling what it was.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Still deeper in the woods they came suddenly
into a cleared place where a number of deer had
taken shelter under a big pine tree. They stood motionless
for a moment and then vanished into a
thicket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I mean about natural magic,&rdquo; Judy
pointed out. &ldquo;Those deer vanished under their own
power&mdash;no tricks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw deer except in the zoo,&rdquo; Paul said
gravely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet that magician couldn&rsquo;t make a deer
jump out of his hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re funny,&rdquo; giggled Penny.</p>
<p>She and Paul were city children. Judy was seeing
sights that were commonplace to her through their
wondering eyes. If they did return with her, she&rsquo;d
have to let them ride Ginger and watch as she
milked Daisy. That would seem like magic to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The talking tree was magic,&rdquo; Penny insisted.
&ldquo;Anne says it told her and Muriel to run, but I only
heard it whisper. If I listen again, maybe it will tell
me a secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard nothing but the wind,&rdquo; Paul said. &ldquo;Is
this the road to Uncle Paul&rsquo;s house? It doesn&rsquo;t look
like a millionaire&rsquo;s estate.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t been very well cared for,&rdquo; Mrs. Riker
agreed. &ldquo;You used to be able to see the top of the
house from here. And where&rsquo;s the gate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just drove through it,&rdquo; Horace replied. &ldquo;It
was standing wide open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Paul never allowed it to be left open.
Something must be wrong,&rdquo; Mrs. Riker exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something is wrong!&rdquo; exclaimed Judy. &ldquo;That
forest fire did spread. The grounds are all burned
over. What a shame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may not be as bad as you think. There seems
to be something up ahead,&rdquo; observed Horace, peering
through the windshield. &ldquo;You can hardly see it
for the rain. Or is it smoke that makes everything
so hazy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I smell wood burning,&rdquo; Honey began. But Paul
interrupted with a shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be the house! I can see the steps
going up to it. Oh, please, stop the car and let me
run up first and tell Uncle Paul who we are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, Paul, wait!&rdquo; cried his mother, as Horace
pulled up at the side of the road.</p>
<p>But the boy was already out of the car with
Penny after him. Blackberry ran ahead of them up
the steps at the top of which was a stout oak door
with stonework all around it and a tall, grim statue
looming up beside the entrance. Suddenly Judy
recognized it from a picture she had seen of the
Hindu god, Shiva. But before she could tell Paul
it was not a house but a vault that he had discovered,
he was knocking loudly on the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<div class="img">

<p class="center">Paul knocked loudly on the door</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really think anyone will answer you,&rdquo;
Judy called. And for some reason it seemed suddenly
funny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; Honey exclaimed when she
saw what it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sentiments exactly,&rdquo; agreed Horace. &ldquo;What
a weird place to build a tomb!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Shiva, the Destroyer, beside the entrance.
And look!&rdquo; Judy gasped. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been plenty of
destruction. You can see that a house once stood
over there, but it&rsquo;s been burned to the ground!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X</span>
<br />Another Voice?</h2>
<p>Everybody piled out of the car to look and exclaim
over what had happened. The fire, apparently,
had swept down from the national forest,
making a path of destruction as far as the vault and
no farther. The vault itself had not been touched.
It was built into the hillside, and the laurel and ivy
growing up and around the statue were as green as
ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even the fire was afraid of that statue,&rdquo; Honey
said with a shiver. &ldquo;Judy! Judy! Did you hear it&mdash;speak?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;What? The statue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More likely it was a ghost,&rdquo; declared Horace.
&ldquo;Those children did knock loud enough to wake
the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; Judy scolded him. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see
you&rsquo;re frightening them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had overcome her first impulse to laugh at
the children&rsquo;s mistake. Now she wanted to cry for
sympathy. They had been so eager to meet their
uncle. Now only the blackened ruins of his home
were left. Not even a chimney remained standing.</p>
<p>Mrs. Riker was shocked into silence at first. But
soon she was trying to tell the children how she
remembered the house. She hadn&rsquo;t seen it for many
years, she said. Perhaps it hadn&rsquo;t been as large as
she had pictured it in her imagination. Her main
concern now was for the man they had come to
visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can it be he&rsquo;s dead?&rdquo; she wondered.</p>
<p>The name on the vault was plain. It was simply
<i>Paul Riker</i> with the date of his birth and then a
blank. The stone tablet bearing the inscription was
just below the figure of Shiva, the Destroyer.</p>
<p>Penny and Paul were gazing up at the statue almost
as if it were alive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared,&rdquo; Penny whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder,&rdquo; her brother answered. &ldquo;I ought
to have known better than to run up to an old
tomb. It was a dumb mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a logical one,&rdquo; Judy consoled him. &ldquo;I might
have thought it was a little house myself if I hadn&rsquo;t
recognized that statue from a picture I saw in a
magazine. In India there are temples to Shiva, or
Siva. I&rsquo;m not sure of the name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember!&rdquo; cried Penny, brightening up as
she thought of it. &ldquo;It was Sita. Oh, no, that&rsquo;s the
name of the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know nothing about it,&rdquo; her mother told
her severely. &ldquo;I know nothing myself except that
Mr. Riker was fond of collecting things. It is like
him to have a Hindu idol on his tomb. Years ago
he was converted, as he called it, to mysticism. I
remember some of the things he used to say. He
and my husband&rsquo;s father used to have long conversations
about the journey a spirit must take before
it reached nirvana, whatever that is. Well, perhaps
he has taken it. Life was the journey, Uncle
Paul used to say, and death the reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sighed, and added, &ldquo;I only hope his nephew
hasn&rsquo;t followed in his footsteps.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;His nephew?&rdquo; asked Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mom means <i>my</i> uncle,&rdquo; Paul explained.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s old Uncle Paul and young Uncle Paul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I should have told you about my husband&rsquo;s
brother,&rdquo; Mrs. Riker continued. &ldquo;He and
my husband were boys when they quarreled&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Honey whispered suddenly,
moving closer to Horace. &ldquo;Did you hear a footstep?&rdquo;
She shivered and he put his coat around her.
The rain seemed to be turning to snow. Unmindful
of it, the children continued to gaze up at the
statue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it move?&rdquo; Judy heard Paul whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the light, Paul,&rdquo; his mother said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really
made of cement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same as sidewalks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. Anyway, it isn&rsquo;t alive. It didn&rsquo;t move,
and it couldn&rsquo;t have spoken to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy looked suspiciously at Horace. Had he
learned to throw his voice? That could be the answer
to the talking trees as well&mdash;except that Horace
hadn&rsquo;t been there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; thought Judy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off on the wrong
trail again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Honey suggested. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Horace had an idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The caretaker&rsquo;s cottage must be back down the
road. I think we passed it without seeing it. Maybe
he can explain it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is there to explain?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Riker
sadly, starting down the steps. &ldquo;Tombs aren&rsquo;t built
for the living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes they are. Sometimes people prefer
to choose their own monuments while they&rsquo;re still
alive, and it looks as if that&rsquo;s the way your uncle
felt about it. There&rsquo;s no death date under his name,&rdquo;
Horace observed. &ldquo;I think the vault is empty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy hoped it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s go back to the car,&rdquo; Honey
urged. &ldquo;If a voice spoke to us now, I really would
run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The children thought they heard one,&rdquo; Judy
called after her teasingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It scared us,&rdquo; Penny confessed. &ldquo;We thought it
was Uncle Paul&rsquo;s ghost. It said, &lsquo;Go away.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, dead people do come back,&rdquo; Paul
put in gravely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s magic, I think. We know, on
account of Daddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw him,&rdquo; Penny added.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;When was this?&rdquo; asked Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a little while ago,&rdquo; Penny said serenely, and
she and Paul ran down the steps to join their mother
and Honey in the car.</p>
<p>Judy would have questioned them further, but
now as she idly tried the heavy oaken door of the
vault, to her amazement, she found it unlocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have we here?&rdquo; she exclaimed as she
swung the door open upon a concrete floor surrounded
by four stone walls. In one swift movement
she stooped and picked up a tiny green object
that lay on the bare concrete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is <i>this</i> the green doll Penny was talking about?&rdquo;
Judy wondered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could be,&rdquo; Horace said. &ldquo;The thieves may be
planning on storing the loot from other robberies
here. Let me have a look at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Later,&rdquo; Judy whispered, slipping the little green
object into her pocket. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something strange
going on around here, and I need time to think
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She swung the heavy door closed. Open, it
would be a temptation to small boys and girls who,
like herself, were fond of shivery adventures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Horace urged her. &ldquo;The vault is
empty, and you&rsquo;re just scaring yourself and getting
all wet standing there. I want to interview that
caretaker and find out what&rsquo;s up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if you will,&rdquo; Judy said, turning reluctantly
to follow him down the long steps back to
the car.</p>
<p>The vault, somehow, had a strange attraction for
her as it did for Blackberry. The cat was climbing
around it, exploring the statue, and the roof, and
Judy longed to join him. If the bushes weren&rsquo;t so
wet she knew she could scramble up there, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come back, won&rsquo;t we, Horace?&rdquo; Judy
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It depends on what the caretaker has to say.
The sky&rsquo;s cleared a little and I can see the top of
his cottage. We did pass it,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;The
fire didn&rsquo;t touch it or the trees around it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s warm inside,&rdquo; Judy said. &ldquo;The air
is getting colder by the minute.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br />At the Caretaker&rsquo;s Cottage</h2>
<p>Judy found the caretaker&rsquo;s cottage cold in more
ways than one. They had approached it eagerly.
It did seem the logical place to inquire about the
mysterious Mr. Paul Riker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll question the caretaker,&rdquo; Horace declared.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll tell us plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But would he? At first the wizened little old
man who came to the door of the cottage refused
to admit them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough people here,&rdquo; he barked. &ldquo;Go
away!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Paul Riker,&rdquo; little Paul piped up unexpectedly.
&ldquo;You have to let us in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be hanged,&rdquo; the caretaker said, &ldquo;if you
don&rsquo;t sound just like your uncle Paul. So I have
to let you in, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paul! Be quiet,&rdquo; Mrs. Riker admonished the
boy. &ldquo;I am Mrs. Philip Riker,&rdquo; she told the caretaker.
&ldquo;Do you know where I can reach Mr. Paul
Riker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Abner Post,&rdquo; the caretaker said, and added
reluctantly, &ldquo;Come in, Mrs. Riker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy and Horace introduced themselves and got
a cold stare for their trouble. Abner Post led them
into his kitchen which was at the front of the house,
and they were offered straight-backed chairs.</p>
<p>The kitchen, Judy noticed, was a little like her
own. It had a fireplace in it, but there was no fire.
The house seemed without warmth or comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve come to find out what&rsquo;s become of
Mr. Riker, have you?&rdquo; the caretaker said to Mrs.
Riker after she had told him about seeing the vault.
&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s plenty would like to know. Some
of the neighbors hereabouts say he&rsquo;s dead and his
ghost walks up and down them steps at midnight.
But I ain&rsquo;t seen it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just how long has Mr. Riker been away, Mr.
Post?&rdquo; Horace asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look here, young feller,&rdquo; the caretaker
turned on Horace belligerently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done nothing
but answer questions all day&mdash;police, insurance
men, fire department&mdash;they all got nothing better
to do than come and bother me. So don&rsquo;t you
start in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mr. Post, please,&rdquo; Mrs. Riker said pleadingly.
&ldquo;I wrote to Mr. Riker over two weeks ago,
telling him I was driving here with the children. I
even told him the route we were taking. Surely,
when he was expecting us, he wouldn&rsquo;t just disappear.
Something must have happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The caretaker shrugged. &ldquo;I dunno, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he
said, and added grudgingly, &ldquo;All I know is, a couple
of weeks ago he suddenly got rid of all the help in
the house, closed it up, and told me he was off on a
trip to India. He said I was to stay on to look after
things, and he&rsquo;d be back when he got back. Some
folks say,&rdquo; he lowered his voice, &ldquo;Paul Riker&rsquo;s
locked himself up in that vault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the door was open and the vault is empty,&rdquo;
Judy protested. &ldquo;What did he build it for, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;He had it built about two years ago,&rdquo; Abner
Post replied. &ldquo;Said he might as well get some good
out of all the money he made when he sold the business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was his business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy had asked the question simply out of curiosity.
She was quite unprepared for the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; Abner Post replied shortly,
handing her a card.</p>
<p>Judy stared at it. Then she passed it around. The
room buzzed with comments. It was startling, to
say the least. On the card was lettered:</p>
<p class="center">RIKER MEMORIALS
<br />Monuments, Mausoleums
<br />Designers and Builders for Four Generations</p>
<p>Underneath was the name, Paul Riker, an address
and phone number, as well as a notation in
very small print: &ldquo;Exhibit Open Every Day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An exhibit!&rdquo; exclaimed Honey, handing the
card back to Judy, who asked if she might keep it.
&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is his own monument on the card, the very
same statue and everything,&rdquo; observed Horace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;And there were four generations of them,&rdquo;
Judy added. &ldquo;But you say he sold the business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk did it,&rdquo; the caretaker explained. &ldquo;All those
heathen statues and pictures he filled the house
with. Folks began calling him a heathen too. It got
even worse after he put up that monument. I told
him he was making a big mistake. &lsquo;What good is a
big tombstone to a man after he&rsquo;s dead?&rsquo; I asked him.
&lsquo;Let others build it if they think you&rsquo;re worth it.&rsquo;
And would you believe it, he told me he had no
friends or kinfolks who thought he was worth a
visit, let alone a monument. He and his nephew
had quarreled over the business, and the rest of the
family let him pretty much alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to Helen Riker. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re Philip&rsquo;s
wife, why didn&rsquo;t you ever come to visit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come,&rdquo; Mrs. Riker said, very low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve come too late. I keep bachelor&rsquo;s
quarters. It&rsquo;s no fit place for a woman, and you can
see for yourself the big house is burned down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did the fire start?&rdquo; Judy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night,&rdquo; Abner Post answered shortly.
&ldquo;And I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> know how it started,&rdquo; he added defensively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could that be because you weren&rsquo;t here?&rdquo; Judy
asked sweetly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I was here,&rdquo; the caretaker exclaimed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t have been here when the house
was looted Thursday night,&rdquo; Judy pointed out
reasonably. &ldquo;From what the paper said, the thieves
must have had to bring a van to remove all those
art treasures, and you would have seen it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look here, miss,&rdquo; the caretaker exclaimed
furiously. &ldquo;Are you trying to say I was mixed up
in the robbery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robbery!&rdquo; Mrs. Riker gasped. &ldquo;Uncle Paul&rsquo;s
beautiful treasures were stolen? Oh, how dreadful!&rdquo;
Suddenly her eyes filled with tears. &ldquo;I suppose
his jade collection was stolen too. Yes,&rdquo; she added
in a whisper, &ldquo;I have come too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy&rsquo;s hand closed around the tiny object in her
pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be too sure of that, Mrs. Riker,&rdquo; she
said mysteriously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>

<br />The Game of Secrets</h2>
<p>Horace made good time coming home. He was
really driving too fast, Judy thought, but she didn&rsquo;t
say anything. She was too busy thinking about the
caretaker, who had stood watching them sullenly
as they drove away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horace,&rdquo; she said suddenly, &ldquo;either that man
<i>was</i> involved in the robbery, or else he was away at
the time and is trying to keep it secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good trying to keep secrets like that,&rdquo;
Honey said. &ldquo;I tried it once, and it didn&rsquo;t work. I
only got myself tangled in a web of lies. It was
when I told the truth that everything came clear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you said that,&rdquo; declared Judy. &ldquo;I think
the truth would solve most of our problems. Don&rsquo;t
you, Mrs. Riker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;will solve my problems
now. I wish I had never come back. At least I could
have kept the memory of the place the way it used
to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it such a pleasant memory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;It was anything but
pleasant except for one happy summer. That
summer stood out so clearly in my memory that
it made me forget all the dreary hours that followed.
It all comes back to me now. The
house was filled with heavy, carved furniture.
There was one chair with snakes curling over the
back. You couldn&rsquo;t sit in it. A statue sat there. You
had to be quiet when you went near it. There were
so many statues! But I think I remember the quiet
most of all. I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to interrupt if anyone
spoke, but nobody ever said anything much except,
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t touch!&rsquo; And there were so many beautiful
things I wanted to touch. Now where are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least they didn&rsquo;t go up in smoke when the
house burned,&rdquo; Horace pointed out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is a strange thing,&rdquo; agreed Judy. &ldquo;The thieves
didn&rsquo;t know they were saving them. Your uncle
should be grateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Riker smiled, as if the thought of his gratitude
amused her. Then she said, &ldquo;What really distresses
me is the condition of the caretaker&rsquo;s cottage.
You wouldn&rsquo;t think it to look at it now, but
that kitchen was once almost as pleasant as yours,
Judy, if I may call you that. Do call me Helen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Honey turned around and smiled at Judy, remembering
a secret between them. She had been
called Helen for a little while before Judy found
out that her real name was Grace Dobbs and that
she was Peter&rsquo;s sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You like that name, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Honey asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I like Helen Riker,&rdquo; Judy declared
warmly. &ldquo;I think we are going to be good friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so. I&rsquo;m like Uncle Paul,&rdquo; Mrs. Riker admitted.
&ldquo;I need friends as I never needed them before.
My husband is dead, as you must have guessed.
He was a reckless driver, especially when he was
alone. He was killed in an accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; asked Horace, cutting down
on his speed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;You heard it. You might take it as a warning,&rdquo;
Judy told him. &ldquo;You have plenty of time to write
up this story. The <i>Herald</i> doesn&rsquo;t go to press until
tomorrow morning. &lsquo;Slow down and live,&rsquo; as the
road signs say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, I will,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I was just trying
to get you home in time for supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get supper better if I&rsquo;m all in one piece. I
haven&rsquo;t decided what we&rsquo;ll have, but you&rsquo;re all
invited,&rdquo; Judy told them.</p>
<p>But Horace said he had other plans&mdash;which included
Honey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; Judy said, &ldquo;we want you and the
children to stay, Helen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Riker smiled as if the use of her first name
cemented their friendship. She was a beautiful
woman when she forgot to be worried and frightened.
Judy guessed she was still in her early thirties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have married very young,&rdquo; she commented
a little later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too young,&rdquo; Helen Riker replied. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t
learned to do my own thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>What did she mean? Apparently she still didn&rsquo;t
want to think about her problems, but the children
did. Penny seemed bursting with things she wanted
to say. They had passed the dam and were just
coming to the place where the North Hollow road
turned off at an angle, when the little girl suddenly
cried out, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where we were when the bad
men went off with Mommy&rsquo;s pocketbook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they go down that road?&rdquo; asked Horace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;They drove off down the main
road. That&rsquo;s where we met those kids who are having
the magic show. But Wally Brown wasn&rsquo;t with
the kids who found Mom&rsquo;s pocketbook&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he didn&rsquo;t want them to look for it!
Maybe it was his voice we heard!&rdquo; exclaimed Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good theory and basically sound,&rdquo; Horace
pointed out, &ldquo;but your timing&rsquo;s wrong. The voice
said &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t look for it!&rsquo; <i>before</i> Mrs. Riker lost her
pocketbook&mdash;not afterwards. I figure the robbery
happened in a matter of minutes after those men
left you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; Honey put in. &ldquo;It was
in the paper this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horace is talking about the theft of the pocketbook,
not the big robbery. But I have a feeling
they&rsquo;re related in some way,&rdquo; Judy said thoughtfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe one is the uncle of the other,&rdquo; Horace
teased her. &ldquo;Seriously,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I agree that
there may be some connection. If this magician had
been with them&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t a robber,&rdquo; Penny interrupted. &ldquo;I know
he isn&rsquo;t. His magic is real. You&rsquo;ll see at the magic
show. We can go to it, now that we&rsquo;re coming back
to live with you, can&rsquo;t we, Judy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; Horace asked in surprise. &ldquo;So
you&rsquo;re going to live with Judy, are you? Don&rsquo;t
you think Peter may have something to say about
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t even know about the tourist sign,&rdquo;
Judy confessed. &ldquo;We put it up this morning as a
sort of a lark. We might have trapped the robbers,
but it looks as if we caught the victims instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have caught them both. The robbers
who stole my pocketbook asked if I knew where
Uncle Paul&rsquo;s jade collection is,&rdquo; Mrs. Riker confessed,
&ldquo;but if the house was robbed two days ago,
they&rsquo;d have been there already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be a story: &lsquo;<span class="small">THIEVES OVERLOOK
VALUABLE JADE COLLECTION</span>,&rsquo;&rdquo; Horace commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But did they?&rdquo; Judy asked. &ldquo;My theory is that
they only overlooked one piece&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>She stopped suddenly, deciding not to mention
the tiny green object in her pocket until she had
shown it to Peter and discussed the whole thing
with him. Quickly she changed the subject to ask,
&ldquo;Could the police have known about the fire when
they gave you the news of the robbery, Horace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Everybody seems to
be playing the game of secrets. The theft of your
pocketbook should have been reported, Mrs. Riker.
You&rsquo;re protecting the thieves when you hold back
information from the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; she said, becoming suddenly flustered.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to do that. I suppose they
should know what happened, but please keep my
name out of it. I don&rsquo;t want to become involved.
Maybe you could tell them I have my pocketbook
back&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Empty,&rdquo; Horace reminded her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t want it,&rdquo; Penny spoke up. &ldquo;They
only wanted what was inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>was</i> inside?&rdquo; asked Judy, hoping her new
friend had taken Honey&rsquo;s little speech about truth-telling
to heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/img004.jpg" alt="&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a light inside,&rdquo; observed Honey" width="500" height="703" />
<p class="center">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a light inside,&rdquo; observed Honey</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; Mrs. Riker replied quickly. &ldquo;I
only had a few dollars left, just about enough to
get us to Uncle Paul&rsquo;s. There was nothing else of
any consequence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No green doll?&rdquo; Judy wanted to ask. But would
Helen Riker admit it? They were nearly home
now, but the game of secrets was not over. Even
Horace acted as if he knew one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does consequence mean?&rdquo; Penny was
asking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dictionary says it&rsquo;s the natural result of an
act,&rdquo; Judy began.</p>
<p>She had read the dictionary once in order to win
a spelling bee, and often quoted definitions from it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it that way. I&rsquo;m so confused I
don&rsquo;t know what I mean,&rdquo; Mrs. Riker confessed. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t tell those horrible men where anything was.
I couldn&rsquo;t have. I didn&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have overlooked something or they
wouldn&rsquo;t have stopped you. How did they know
who you were?&rdquo; asked Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A voice from the trees told them, no doubt,&rdquo;
Horace said dryly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Her brother was joking, Judy knew. But he had
certainly found out something. They were just
passing the tree that had &ldquo;talked,&rdquo; but there was
no voice from it now. The rain had turned to snow
which clung to the branches, frosting them with
white. The house had a white roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a light inside,&rdquo; observed Honey as Horace
drove up the snowy slope to stop before the
door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br />Too Many Clues</h2>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with this?&rdquo; asked
Horace as he brought in the tourist sign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you ought to hide it,&rdquo; laughed Honey,
taking it from him and standing it behind the
kitchen door.</p>
<p>Usually the door into the combined kitchen
and dining room was left open. It swung against
the living-room wall. From within the kitchen
came the odor of something cooking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;Peter has given me up for lost and is cooking
his own supper,&rdquo; Judy exclaimed. &ldquo;Come in,
Helen. Mrs. Riker, I want you to meet my husband,
Peter Dobbs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter looked more like a coal miner than a
G-man as he turned from the stove to regard the
group in the doorway. A boyish grin spread slowly
over his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to know you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If I had been
warned that Judy was bringing company home I
would have dressed for the occasion and prepared
something more elaborate than canned soup. You&rsquo;ll
have to excuse my appearance,&rdquo; he added after a
quick introduction to the children, &ldquo;but fighting
forest fires is dirty work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forest fires!&rdquo; exclaimed Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a forest ranger?&rdquo; Paul wanted to
know. &ldquo;Did you help put out the fire that burned
Uncle Paul&rsquo;s house down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I was too late for that,&rdquo; replied Peter,
&ldquo;but I did volunteer to help the chief deputy and
his forest rangers. They had to keep the forest fire
from spreading. The control of forest fires,&rdquo; he
continued, &ldquo;is everybody&rsquo;s business. Even boys and
girls can help by reporting any brush fires they
see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see the fire. We just saw the Destroyer,&rdquo;
Paul said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paul means the statue on his uncle&rsquo;s tomb,&rdquo;
Judy put in quickly. &ldquo;I recognized it and told him
what it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You recognized it? Were you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter had abandoned his soup-making to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all were,&rdquo; Honey answered. &ldquo;Mrs. Riker
was on the way to visit her uncle&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is my husband&rsquo;s uncle, not mine,&rdquo; Helen
Riker pointed out. &ldquo;That makes him the children&rsquo;s
great-uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy laughed. &ldquo;Little Paul ran up to the vault
and knocked, and he thinks he heard someone say
&lsquo;Go away!&rsquo; And, honestly, Peter, there was no one
inside. We looked, and it was empty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The voice must have been carried from somewhere,&rdquo;
Horace concluded. &ldquo;It could have been a
trick of the wind, like the talking tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what you think it was?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t see how a trick of the wind could make a tree
talk, do you, Peter?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;If the trees I saw today could have talked,&rdquo; he
replied, &ldquo;they would have all screamed, &lsquo;Save us!&rsquo;
We did our best, but it was the rain that finally put
the fire out, after the wind changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was just about the time those men stopped
here, wasn&rsquo;t it, Judy?&rdquo; asked Honey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What men?&rdquo; asked Peter. &ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder,&rdquo; Judy told him. &ldquo;We took the sign
down and hid it behind the door. Here it is,&rdquo; she
added, dragging it out. &ldquo;You might call it Exhibit
A. Isn&rsquo;t it a beauty? Honey lettered it herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tourists Welcome,&rdquo; he read aloud, the puzzled
frown on his forehead deepening. &ldquo;What was the
idea?&rdquo; he questioned. &ldquo;Are we suddenly in the
tourist business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we were,&rdquo; Judy admitted, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;re
also deep in another mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eagerly the children began telling him about it,
but their mother stopped their chatter by offering
them some of the soup Judy was dishing out, and
telling them to keep quiet while they ate it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t dish out any for us, Judy,&rdquo; Horace told
her. &ldquo;I promised Honey I&rsquo;d take her out to dinner,
and I mean to keep my word if all the restaurants
aren&rsquo;t closed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back if they are. &lsquo;Bye, all!&rdquo; Honey
said as she followed him out into the snow.</p>
<p>The ground was covered now. What a day it had
been! First the dry weather with forest fires raging,
then rain, and now snow!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just too much for me,&rdquo; sighed Judy.</p>
<p>Peter had had a word privately with Horace before
he left. Afterwards Judy brought out what she
called Exhibit B&mdash;the empty pocketbook. Peter
whistled in surprise when he saw it. But Mrs. Riker
seemed unwilling to talk about it. She soon pleaded
a headache and asked that she and the children be
shown to their rooms.</p>
<p>Judy made them as comfortable as she could in
the two spare bedrooms and then returned to the
kitchen to prepare a little more supper for Peter.
She gave him the kiss she had been saving for him
and said, &ldquo;I thought you might like to follow the
soup course with another one of meat and potatoes.
I&rsquo;ll have them on your plate in a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about your own plate?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not hungry,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;I had enough
to eat with Mrs. Riker and the children. For once
we have a mystery with too many clues and I&rsquo;d
rather sort them out in my mind and talk. Peter,&rdquo;
she asked abruptly, &ldquo;did you ever hear of a green
dolly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked puzzled. &ldquo;A green dollar? Who
hasn&rsquo;t? They&rsquo;re all green except the silver and
gold ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say <i>dollar</i>. I said <i>dolly</i>. You know, one
of those things that children play with.&rdquo; She spelled
it, &ldquo;D-o-l-l,&rdquo; and Peter laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn off the advertising, Angel. I get it. Are
you speaking of a talking doll?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;Penny asked me
to help her find a green doll she said her mother
had in the pocketbook that was stolen from her.
But Helen Riker won&rsquo;t tell me. She said there was
nothing of any consequence in her pocketbook, but
there was certainly something worth stealing. Those
men must have been looking for her when they
stopped here. I took the license number of their
car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good girl,&rdquo; approved Peter. &ldquo;I knew you
would. Now, if you can describe them&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy described them in detail, answering a few
more questions Peter asked her about them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;They stopped short in front of Helen Riker and
crowded her car into the ditch. Then the men
jumped out and questioned her about her uncle&rsquo;s
jade collection at the point of a gun. She told me
that much. But she won&rsquo;t admit she had anything
of value in the pocketbook they drove off with.
What do you think was in it, Peter? Why do I get
mixed up in such fantastic adventures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he replied mysteriously, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s because
you&rsquo;re married to me. I&rsquo;m on the trail of a green
doll myself. In fact, quite a number of them. These
clues you speak of may be just the ones I need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter! Really? Then maybe I <i>can</i> help you.
Take a look at Exhibit C!&rdquo; And Judy drew the tiny
green jade figure from her pocket and laid it down
before him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br />The Missing Jade</h2>
<p>Peter gave a long, low whistle of surprise. Then
he asked Judy exactly where she had found the little
idol.</p>
<p>She told him and added, &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t quite the way
Penny described it. This looks more like a hunter
than a doll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be a clue when we start hunting for the
rest of the jade collection,&rdquo; declared Peter. &ldquo;Have
you any more clues as good as this one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not, but it won&rsquo;t do
any harm to list the clues I do have.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; Peter said, &ldquo;is that tourist sign. I&rsquo;ll
never understand how you get these sudden impulses,
but it certainly led Mrs. Riker and the children
to the right place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Judy admitted, and sighed. &ldquo;Naturally
they were looking forward to meeting their
uncle. It must have been a terrible shock to them to
find his house destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about their other uncle?&rdquo; asked Peter.
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he have a house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Judy replied. &ldquo;Helen wouldn&rsquo;t
let the children talk about him. Penny acted as if
she&rsquo;d never heard of him before. It was the old
uncle they were expecting to visit, not the young
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure of anything,&rdquo; confessed Judy.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a big secret of some kind. Helen&rsquo;s trained
Paul to keep it, but not Penny. The trouble is, I
don&rsquo;t think Penny knows all of it. And she has such
an imagination! I actually feel sorry for her, the
way they stop her every time she wants to talk. But
it may be necessary. Helen Riker may be in danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about you?&rdquo; asked Peter. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve really
handed yourself a problem, sweetheart. If she&rsquo;s in
danger, I&rsquo;m afraid you are, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Peter.&rdquo; Impulsively she kissed away the
worried frown on his forehead, nearly stabbing him
with the pencil she was holding. &ldquo;But why should
I be any safer than you are?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
nearly always in danger&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From pencils? Only when I&rsquo;m with you,&rdquo; he
returned, laughing. &ldquo;Actually, pencils are about the
only weapons I&rsquo;ll be using for the next few weeks.
Most of the time I will be sitting at an office desk
doing very undangerous routine work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t today,&rdquo; she reminded him. &ldquo;You
were fighting forest fires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was a little unusual. But let&rsquo;s
talk about your day. I want to get the facts
straightened out in my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My day?&rdquo; Judy questioned, thinking back.
&ldquo;For me it always begins when I first open my
eyes and say to myself, &lsquo;Here is another mystery
to solve.&rsquo; Every day <i>is</i> a mystery, Peter, because
you never know one minute what wonderful, beautiful,
or even terrible thing will happen the next.
That&rsquo;s what makes life so exciting and&mdash;and wonderful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It takes a pretty wonderful person to see it that
way,&rdquo; declared Peter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wonderful, too,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;How
foolish I was to worry for fear you might not understand.
You see, we put up the tourist sign before
Horace came with the news of the robbery. At first
it was just for fun. We didn&rsquo;t really think anyone
would stop. And then, just after we put up the sign,
those three men came along. They didn&rsquo;t drive
down our road. Maybe it looked too steep or something.
They just parked their car by the mailbox
and started to explore the grounds and ask questions.
One of the men asked about the house, but I
told him it wasn&rsquo;t for sale. It&rsquo;s <i>our</i> house, Peter.
Nothing in the world could make me want to sell
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is a little lonesome, is that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;when you&rsquo;re at work.
But today Honey was with me, and then of course
Helen and the children came. Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed
suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What now, Angel?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;An idea I had. Penny did say something about
getting into trouble when you didn&rsquo;t tell things,&rdquo;
Judy remembered. &ldquo;She was talking about her
mother. And then she said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d never, never steal
anything after what she told me. Only bad people
steal.&rsquo; I agreed with her and it seemed to bother
her, and then she said something about it&rsquo;s being
different for children. What do you suppose she
meant by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously some child she cared about had stolen
something. I doubt if it was Penny herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it Paul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I&rsquo;m any judge of character,&rdquo; Peter said.
&ldquo;What else can you remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of things. I&rsquo;ll write them down. There
were still more clues in the paper if we only had it.
I think Helen must have taken it upstairs with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need it,&rdquo; Peter told her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m familiar
with every word in it. You see, our office released
the news. Horace didn&rsquo;t tell you, but he got it from
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did? Then you know more about it than he
does! Can you tell me who the thieves were?&rdquo; Judy
asked. &ldquo;Was it the caretaker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly, although it was he who reported the
robbery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what about the jade collection? If this
green doll was part of it&mdash;Peter! It must have been.
But why was Helen taking it there unless&mdash;&rdquo; Judy
kept interrupting herself as more ideas flashed
through her brain. Then, suddenly, she knew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I remember it now! It
said in the paper that a priceless Oriental jade collection
had been stolen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was believed to have been stolen,&rdquo; Peter corrected
her. &ldquo;It makes quite a difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in what I&rsquo;m trying to say,&rdquo; she continued.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember it word for word, but it went on
to say that the valuable jade pieces had been collected
during Paul Riker&rsquo;s travels through the Far
East. They were little statues of gods and goddesses!
I had forgotten that until this very minute.
And there was something else about their value being
even greater if they were matched pairs. Does
that mean there&rsquo;s a goddess for every god? Then,
if one happened to be missing, it would be worth a
lot of money, wouldn&rsquo;t it? And if the burglars
knew where it was, they&rsquo;d try to steal it, wouldn&rsquo;t
they? And they&rsquo;d try to find out about the rest of
the collection. Oh, Peter! That was what you meant
when you said you were on the trail of quite a
number of green dolls, wasn&rsquo;t it? And this one I
found may lead us to all the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may,&rdquo; Peter replied soberly. &ldquo;On the other
hand, it may lead us into more trouble. If Mr. Riker
himself dropped it in the vault&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;I give up,&rdquo; Judy interrupted. &ldquo;But this green
&lsquo;doll&rsquo; is jade, isn&rsquo;t it, and it was stolen from Mr.
Riker&rsquo;s collection, don&rsquo;t you think, Peter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; Peter agreed, &ldquo;but if anyone stole it
I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re the guilty one, Angel. You&rsquo;d better
let me have it before it gets you into more trouble.
It may be the mate to the one Mrs. Riker had
stolen from her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; Judy began. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of
that. I didn&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Peter reassured her. &ldquo;I
know your motives were good when you took it,
and a great deal of good may come out of it, so
don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Judy promised, inspiration suddenly
erasing all worry from her mind. &ldquo;Oh, Peter!&rdquo; she
cried. &ldquo;I have a wonderful idea. Come up to the
attic with me. There&rsquo;s something up there I want
to show you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>

<br />Secrets of the East</h2>
<p>Judy and Peter climbed to the third floor, tiptoeing
so as not to disturb their sleeping guests. All
was quiet on the second floor. The stairway went
right on up to what was not a cobwebby old attic,
but three neat little rooms at the top of the house.</p>
<p>The room in the middle had dormer windows
that gave enough light for sewing. Here Judy had
placed her sewing machine. Opposite it was a large
chest of drawers, a chair, and a bookcase filled with
things she treasured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>In one of the other rooms her grandmother&rsquo;s
things were stored. Judy had never got around to
sorting all of them.</p>
<p>In the third room were things she had saved herself.
The wall was lined with books she had loved
and didn&rsquo;t want to part with. She had taken them
all to her grandmother&rsquo;s house the summer before
the flood. Her old dolls were there too.</p>
<p>It was in this room that Judy found what she was
looking for&mdash;a stack of old magazines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be in this pile here somewhere,&rdquo; she told
Peter, rapidly going through the stack. &ldquo;It was an
article in an old issue of <i>Life</i>, and it had lots of
pictures in color of Hindu gods and goddesses. I&rsquo;ll
know it by its cover&mdash;a Hindu girl with some kind
of an ornament on her forehead. Do you remember
it, Peter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I do,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;There were pictures
of gods and goddesses on a big fold-out page. Some
of them were in the Riker collection. They were
hardly what you&rsquo;d call dolls, although some of them
were green. To the more educated Hindus they
have become symbolic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean like our sandman?&rdquo; asked Judy with
a yawn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Peter laughed. &ldquo;I never thought of it that way,
but I guess the sandman is a symbol of sleep, and
you and I could use some of it. We can look
through the rest of these old magazines another
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use. It isn&rsquo;t here. We&rsquo;d better go down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy picked up Buttercup, her favorite doll.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tuck her in bed with Penny,&rdquo; she
told Peter, &ldquo;so she&rsquo;ll find her when she wakes up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed at Peter&rsquo;s objections as she carried
the doll down to the children&rsquo;s bedroom on the
second floor and placed her in Penny&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, I didn&rsquo;t wake Penny,&rdquo; she whispered
to Peter. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she an angel? I wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wish went unexpressed as Judy pounced
upon the very magazine she had been hunting for.
It was on the little night table right by Penny&rsquo;s bed,
and it was open to the big fold-out page covered
with pictures of Hindu gods and goddesses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead! You can take it,&rdquo; Paul said so suddenly
that he startled Judy and nearly made her
drop the magazine.</p>
<p>He was wide awake in the other bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you find it?&rdquo; Judy whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the closet. I was showing Penny the pictures.
Is it almost morning?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;Almost,&rdquo; Judy told him. &ldquo;Now go back to
sleep. I&rsquo;d better follow my own advice,&rdquo; she said
to Peter when they were in their own room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to take that magazine to bed
with you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Judy still had it in her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she retorted, making a face at him.
&ldquo;It contains all the mysterious secrets of the mysterious
East and if I want to solve this mysterious&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darling,&rdquo; Peter interrupted, &ldquo;if I hear that
word again I shall place a blindfold over your mysterious
gray eyes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try it!&rdquo; she challenged him.</p>
<p>Judy won the scuffle. In spite of Peter&rsquo;s protests,
she began to read the article, though not from the
beginning. She had opened the magazine to a huge
picture of Shiva.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; she pointed out, &ldquo;is Shiva or Siva, the
death god or the Destroyer. I recognized the figure
on the tomb from this picture. But Penny mentioned
the name Sita, and that seems to ring a bell,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;It should.&rdquo; Peter turned the page and spread it
out before her. &ldquo;Here they are,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Rama
and Sita are the ideal man and woman in India.
They should never be separated, and no marriage is
complete without their blessing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather sweet, don&rsquo;t you think? Oh!&rdquo;
Judy gasped, pointing to one of the two little idols
pictured. &ldquo;Look, Peter. This is the one I found in
the vault. Our green doll is Rama!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br />The Missing Children</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Rama!&rdquo; Peter exclaimed with satisfaction.
&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re getting somewhere, Angel. If we can
just make sure this is not the &lsquo;green doll&rsquo; that was
stolen from Mrs. Riker&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost sure it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Judy exclaimed. &ldquo;When
Penny was talking about it, she kept referring to
the dolly as &lsquo;she,&rsquo; and this little idol is the figure of
a young man. Besides, Peter,&rdquo; she added excitedly,
&ldquo;when I was trying to think of the name of the
Destroyer, Penny said the name was Sita. Then she
said, &lsquo;Oh, no, that was the name of the&mdash;&rsquo; and her
mother made her be quiet. Oh dear,&rdquo; she finished
mournfully, &ldquo;we found Rama and lost Sita, and
they should always be together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they will be, Angel, soon,&rdquo; Peter promised
mysteriously.</p>
<p>Judy eyed him curiously. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t answer this if
it&rsquo;s confidential information,&rdquo; she began carefully,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m just dying to know why it makes a difference
whether this green doll is the one Helen Riker
had, or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t answer your question specifically, Angel,&rdquo;
Peter said slowly. &ldquo;But I can tell you one
thing, because it will be released to the papers tomorrow
anyway. There may not have been a robbery
at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; Judy stared. &ldquo;What do you mean? The
art treasures are gone, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;They were,&rdquo; Peter said. &ldquo;But we learned today
that the Montrose Moving and Storage Company
received an order to move the stuff to their warehouse
on Thursday evening. The order is supposed
to have come from Paul Riker. My theory is that
the old man saw the forest fire spreading in the direction
of his house, and wanted to save his treasures.
However, the insurance people take a different
view. They point out that although the house
did burn down, the forest fire was not the cause.
In fact, the burned area around the site of the Riker
mansion was what stopped the spread of the forest
fire in that direction. They think Mr. Riker wanted
to &lsquo;have his cake and eat it too,&rsquo; as the saying goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; Judy&rsquo;s eyes were snapping with excitement.
&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me all those things have
been sitting in a warehouse while everyone has been
trying to catch the robbers? But you yourself said
only this evening that you are on the trail of a number
of green dolls. Oh,&rdquo; she gasped, as the thought
struck her, &ldquo;that must mean the jade collection
isn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped suddenly as Peter put a gentle hand
over her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to answer your next
question, Angel,&rdquo; he said, laughing at her startled
expression, &ldquo;so let&rsquo;s change the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Peter,&rdquo; Judy laughed too, &ldquo;at least we
have one real robbery left&mdash;those men who held up
Helen Riker. Peter, they must have been the moving
men! Honey recognized one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s undoubtedly some connection, and
we&rsquo;ll investigate it,&rdquo; Peter said. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think
it&rsquo;s quite as simple as it sounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean, there&rsquo;s Helen Riker herself? I told
her I was afraid I&rsquo;d caught the victim instead of the
robbers. And do you know what she said, Peter?
She said, &lsquo;You may have caught them both.&rsquo; But she
couldn&rsquo;t be involved in a robbery that didn&rsquo;t happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that was a piece of stolen jade she was carrying
around with her, she&rsquo;s going to have a hard time
proving her innocence,&rdquo; declared Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow, I can&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;s really guilty,&rdquo;
Judy murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; Peter said, &ldquo;but we both know
she&rsquo;s holding something back. And if her husband
was this millionaire&rsquo;s nephew, why was she driving
a fifteen-year-old car hardly fit for the road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horace told you about the car, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I mean to have a look at it. There&rsquo;s
still a lot we don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a lot I&rsquo;m too sleepy to think about. There
was one more thing I wanted to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, maybe?&rdquo; Peter laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready
to turn in myself as soon as I run downstairs and
make a couple of telephone calls.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;At this hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter laughed. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t wake anybody up. I&rsquo;ll
put out Blackberry and lock up. By then you may
have thought of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He returned a few minutes later. Judy was still
awake. She said a little drowsily, &ldquo;I know what it
was. I wanted to tell you how she described her
uncle&rsquo;s house, the quiet and everything, almost as if
she used to live there, but how could that be? Paul
Riker was her husband&rsquo;s uncle, not hers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew my grandparents when I was a little
boy,&rdquo; Peter reminded her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. She must have lived near them. But
there are no other houses near by except the caretaker&rsquo;s
cottage. Could she have been the caretaker&rsquo;s
little girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask her?&rdquo; Peter suggested.</p>
<p>Judy said she would first thing in the morning.
But morning brought new problems. Mrs. Riker
woke everybody up screaming that the children
were missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found a doll in Penny&rsquo;s bed,&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;It
was put there as a warning&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was put there as a surprise,&rdquo; Judy told her.
&ldquo;I tiptoed in and put it there myself. It&rsquo;s my old
doll, Buttercup, and there&rsquo;s nothing mysterious
about her. The children were all right then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t now. This is too much!&rdquo; Helen
Riker cried, becoming hysterical. &ldquo;If those robbers
entered the house during the night and stole them,
I&rsquo;ll never forgive myself. Maybe they think I lied to
them when I said I didn&rsquo;t know where Uncle Paul
kept his jade collection. They may think if they
hold the children they can force me to tell&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo; Peter stopped her. &ldquo;Before
you jump to any such conclusions, tell me when
you last saw the children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, when I put them to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter made a quick investigation, and reported
that no one had entered the children&rsquo;s room except
Judy and himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about their clothes?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Are any
of them missing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must be wearing their snow suits,&rdquo; their
mother began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not, on a nice snowy morning?&rdquo;
asked Peter. &ldquo;It looks to me as if they just got up
early and ran out to play.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>But Helen Riker still wouldn&rsquo;t believe they
hadn&rsquo;t met with some disaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;ve decided to track those robbers down
by themselves,&rdquo; she wailed, &ldquo;some real harm may
come to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that it doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; promised Peter.</p>
<p>Judy made three phone calls. Then she and Peter
put on coats and boots and began an exploration of
the neighborhood. The new snow helped, and they
soon discovered that Penny and Paul had left a path
from the house to the barn and then across the
shortcut to the North Hollow road.</p>
<p>Judy&rsquo;s friend and nearest neighbor, Holly Potter,
reported that she had seen the children a half hour
or so earlier. They were on their way toward the
new housing development, she thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Muriel&rsquo;s house is on the corner. They could
have been on their way there,&rdquo; she added as Judy
hurried off with Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I called Ricky and Muriel and Anne before we
came out. They hadn&rsquo;t seen them,&rdquo; she called back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That leaves Wally, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked Peter.
&ldquo;Did you think of calling him? That&rsquo;s where they
were planning to have this magic show, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. Why didn&rsquo;t I think of it? That&rsquo;s
where they naturally would go. Let&rsquo;s go back to the
house and telephone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the car out and drive over and pick them
up if you like,&rdquo; Peter offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, and in the meantime I&rsquo;ll get breakfast
started,&rdquo; Judy decided. &ldquo;What do you fancy this
morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pancakes would do very nicely. I&rsquo;ve worked up
quite an appetite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pancakes it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They returned to the house hand in hand and enjoying
the crisp morning air. Overnight it had
changed from fall to winter. As Peter drove off
along the snowy road Judy waved to him and then
turned to Mrs. Riker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll find them. Don&rsquo;t worry. Let&rsquo;s go inside
and have a nice hot breakfast ready for them when
they do come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Church bells were ringing, reminding them that
it was Sunday morning. For Judy and Peter this
was never a day for sleeping. Usually they drove to
Farringdon and attended church with Judy&rsquo;s parents
and Peter&rsquo;s grandparents. Horace never missed
a Sunday.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;Honey will be there, too. And Lois and Lorraine
and all the other girls I knew in high school,&rdquo;
thought Judy.</p>
<p>But when she suggested church to Mrs. Riker
the young woman protested that she didn&rsquo;t want to
meet people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What did she mean? Judy had suggested the little
white church in Dry Brook Hollow, as it was already
too late to drive to Farringdon, and the children
had not yet returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might look for them in Sunday school if
Peter isn&rsquo;t back by ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy felt sure some of the neighborhood children
might have invited them. She didn&rsquo;t know
why, but she just couldn&rsquo;t share Mrs. Riker&rsquo;s anxiety,
although she could sympathize with her. The
pancake batter was ready. Ten o&rsquo;clock came and
still no children. Mrs. Riker was the first one to suggest
walking over to the Sunday school.</p>
<p>They arrived just as all the children were singing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>Come, ye thankful people, come,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Raise the song of harvest-home.</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>All is safely gathered in,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Ere the winter storms begin.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Thanksgiving Sunday!&rdquo; Judy whispered.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Riker was looking into the faces of the
children and finding nothing to be thankful for.
Her own were not there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br />More Secrets</h2>
<p>They waited until the hymn was over and then
tiptoed quietly out of the big Sunday school room.
A moment later the quiet was shattered as the children
rushed off to their individual classrooms. The
Dran boys hurried in through the outside door.
They were both out of breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we late?&rdquo; the older boy asked Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; the younger one lamented. &ldquo;We
missed the singing and that&rsquo;s the best part. We
wanted Penny and Paul to come with us, but Peter
said their mother would worry&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank the Lord,&rdquo; gasped Mrs. Riker.</p>
<p>She looked about ready to faint. The Dran boys
stared at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s their mother,&rdquo; Judy explained. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
been worried sick. But it&rsquo;s all right now. We can all
be thankful they&rsquo;re safe. But where were they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At our house,&rdquo; the boys said matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wanted to sign up for the magic show,&rdquo;
Timothy, the older of the two, explained. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
they tell you where they were going, Mrs. Riker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied rather uncertainly as if she
wanted to say more. She looked at Judy, who
should have introduced them. In the excitement
she had forgotten to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. Peter brought them back and gave
us a ride,&rdquo; Timothy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t wait for you. I guess he didn&rsquo;t know
you were here,&rdquo; Barry, the little one, added.</p>
<p>Having explained everything, the Dran boys ran
off to their classes which were somewhere in the
basement rooms of the church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny and Paul would have enjoyed this.
Maybe I&rsquo;ll let them come next Sunday,&rdquo; Helen
Riker remarked as they left to walk home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next Sunday?&rdquo; Judy questioned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>Was Mrs. Riker planning to stay all winter?
What were her plans? Judy knew she couldn&rsquo;t ask
her new friend to leave when she didn&rsquo;t have anywhere
to go, or any money, but she hadn&rsquo;t counted
on taking in a whole family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; Mrs. Riker replied. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t decided
anything. But at least I have something to be
thankful for. The children are all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they reached Judy&rsquo;s home they found
Penny and Paul helping Peter make pancakes. He
had discovered the batter and the griddle ready, and
had appointed himself chef in Judy&rsquo;s absence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pancakes coming up!&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Pitch
right in, everybody. Know where we&rsquo;re going as
soon as we finish, Angel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, where?&rdquo; Judy asked.</p>
<p>But before Peter could tell her, Mrs. Riker said
what she wanted to know was where the children
had been and why they hadn&rsquo;t told her they were
going out.</p>
<p>The answer to the last question was simple
enough. She had been asleep when they left.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was very early,&rdquo; Paul explained. &ldquo;We had to
wake everybody up. Mr. Brown didn&rsquo;t like it, but
when we went to Timmy Dran&rsquo;s house the magician
didn&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The magician!&rdquo; their mother said in shocked
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that where you were?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;I might
have known it! Where does this magician live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Barry and Timothy Dran. He&rsquo;s the nicest
man, just like Daddy, only he isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s all right if
we go there,&rdquo; Paul hurried on. &ldquo;Peter knows him.
They got real well acquainted, and we joined the
club and Penny has a part in the magic show. She
and Anne changed places because now she&rsquo;s the
littlest. Wally said it was all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I disappear,&rdquo; Penny announced proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not again,&rdquo; her mother protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;ll come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Riker sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope so. At least you&rsquo;re safe now. The
next time you leave the house you must tell me, so
I won&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;You know how
much I&rsquo;ve had on my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I did,&rdquo; Judy thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know. But it&rsquo;s going to be different now,
isn&rsquo;t it, Penny?&rdquo; Paul asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oooh, yes!&rdquo; she squealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More secrets!&rdquo; Judy said, holding up her hands
in mock despair. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t we enough already!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She still had Mrs. Riker&rsquo;s problems to solve and
they weren&rsquo;t easy. As they did the dishes together
she encouraged the young woman to talk. The
truth came out unexpectedly when Mrs. Riker
commented that their kitchen used to be almost as
nice as Judy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d never think it to look at it now, but when
we lived in the caretaker&rsquo;s cottage on the Riker
estate, it was the coziest, warmest little place you
ever saw. The boys used to come down whenever
Mother made cookies&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys?&rdquo; Judy questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My husband Philip, and his brother Paul. I liked
Paul best then,&rdquo; she continued in a voice that told
Judy she had decided to take her into her confidence.
&ldquo;We were children, of course, but I used to
think it was Paul I would marry. And then, suddenly,
everything changed. After we left the caretaker&rsquo;s
cottage and went to live in the city, it was
Philip who wrote to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what happened to Paul?&rdquo; Judy asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw him again,&rdquo; Helen said, &ldquo;but Philip
came to New York and looked me up. He said he
and Paul had quarreled and that he, Philip, had been
disinherited. Their money never mattered to me,
anyway. I loved them both&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped, but Judy made no comment. She
was afraid of breaking the spell. It was almost as if
Helen Riker were reliving her past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t have said that, but it&rsquo;s true!&rdquo;
she declared. &ldquo;It used to break my heart when they
quarreled. Philip was jealous of Paul because their
uncle favored him and called Philip a little thief. He
did take things to give away. Uncle Paul had so
much, Phil thought it didn&rsquo;t matter. They were
only there on a visit, but it was the happiest summer
in my whole life. Afterwards&mdash;but why talk
about it? It&rsquo;s all in the past and I have the future to
think about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could there be a link?&rdquo; asked Judy, thinking
fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean if one of the presents Philip gave you
happened to be in the pocketbook that was
stolen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Riker&rsquo;s face went white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo; she questioned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Judy smiled, taking the dish the other had nearly
dropped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was just a guess. Your little daughter Penny
is like her mother. She isn&rsquo;t very good at keeping
secrets. A green doll would be a green goddess,
wouldn&rsquo;t it? Possibly a jade goddess worth quite a
bit to a thief who had the mate&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rama!&rdquo; Helen gasped. &ldquo;Paul always said it was
bad luck to separate them!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br />Sita Speaks</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Bad luck?&rdquo; Judy asked, turning from the corner
cupboard where she had just placed a stack of five
plates, the last of the breakfast dishes. Or were they
lunch dishes? Their pancake feast had waited so
long that it was nearly lunchtime before they had
finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe in it, do you?&rdquo; Mrs. Riker
questioned anxiously. &ldquo;I guess you think we make
our own luck, good or bad, and maybe you&rsquo;re
right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;But if that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Judy said, &ldquo;we can change
it. You&rsquo;ve made a good start, telling me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell you quite all,&rdquo; Helen admitted. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t tell you how we used to act out the story of
Rama and Sita. Do you know it, Judy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a little of it,&rdquo; Judy answered. &ldquo;I know
they are the ideal man and woman, but was Sita a
princess? Penny said the green doll was a princess,
but I guess she got the story mixed up with the Oz
books. Did you read them to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I read her the Oz books, not the &lsquo;Ramayana.&rsquo;
There isn&rsquo;t a translation of it that a child Penny&rsquo;s
age could understand. We heard the story told and
made up our own play. I would call, &lsquo;Rama! Rama!
Rama! I seek thee within me and my senses are
sealed.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Rama answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it was always the demon Ravana. He was
the many-headed monster who stole Sita and kept
her a prisoner for seven years. The boys would take
turns being Ravana. The other one was always
Rama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you were Sita? Did you take the statues to
act out the play?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;At first,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Then Uncle Paul discovered
us and forbade us to touch them. After that we
thought of him as the many-headed demon. When
he roared at us we&rsquo;d exchange glances and know
each other&rsquo;s thoughts. I&rsquo;ve seen you and Peter do it.
I think two people can when they love each other
very much, but it didn&rsquo;t last with us. When Sita
was stolen everything changed. Paul didn&rsquo;t want to
play any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;Was it Philip
who took the statue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He gave it to me and told me to
keep it for seven years and then he would bring me
its mate. He did find me just seven years later, but
neither of us ever mentioned Rama and Sita. We
were married, I often told myself, without their
blessing. Paul didn&rsquo;t come to the wedding. None of
his family did. My mother and some of my friends
from New York were there. But I never saw Paul
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you did see him&mdash;&rdquo; Judy began.</p>
<p>But Helen Riker was crying now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d still love him, I guess. Little Paul is really
named for him, not for Mr. Riker. I was always a
little afraid of old Uncle Paul. And now I&rsquo;m afraid
of meeting either of them. Can you guess why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you kept the green goddess?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it&rsquo;s more than that. I&rsquo;m afraid of what
may have happened during the years I didn&rsquo;t know
him. If he&rsquo;s grown up to be bitter and cruel like his
uncle, with no understanding of children&mdash; And if
he hasn&rsquo;t&mdash;why, then he&rsquo;s probably married to
someone else. I&rsquo;d pretend I didn&rsquo;t care any more if
I found out Paul was happily married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Judy said, and there were tears in her
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really do, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Mrs. Riker spoke as
if she wasn&rsquo;t used to having people understand her
feelings. But now that someone did, she was ready
to pour out her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was what made it so hard,&rdquo; she went on
with her story. &ldquo;I loved the green doll, as I called
her, and didn&rsquo;t want to part with her, because
Philip had given her to me. After he was killed in
the accident two years ago, it seemed even harder
to part with her, and I didn&rsquo;t, even though we
needed money desperately. She reminded me of
those happy days when the three of us played together
and took turns and I didn&rsquo;t have to choose
between them. They were twins&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo; Judy stopped her. &ldquo;Did I hear
you correctly? Did you say they were twins?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;Identical twins,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Some people
couldn&rsquo;t tell one from the other, but I could. Philip
laughed more than Paul did. He was more reckless,
too. When we played follow-the-leader, he would
lead us places that Paul and I were afraid to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of places?&rdquo; asked Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there was a cave in the side of the mountain.
I don&rsquo;t remember exactly where it was. It was
a natural cave,&rdquo; she remembered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t imagine
it&rsquo;s there any more. It seems to me it was about
where that monument stood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could the monument have been built over it?
That might explain the voice that told the children
to go away. It would explain the footstep, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he was there!&rdquo; Helen Riker exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Uncle Paul,&rdquo; she replied with a shiver. &ldquo;He
knew about the cave. He chased us out and took
possession of it for himself just as he took possession
of everything he wanted. I hated him for his
selfishness. I wanted to hurt him. I knew it was
wrong to keep the statue, but it was my way of
paying him back. He must have turned queer to
build a tomb and hide in a cave underneath it to
scare people. I wonder if he knew who we were.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;How could he know? Do you think he was
peeking out from somewhere? But how could he
know you even if he was? You were a little girl
then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m like my
mother. I thought perhaps I could keep house for
him like my mother did. Our one hope was that he
would welcome us and forgive me when I gave him
back the little jade statue of Sita. But now it&rsquo;s stolen
and he didn&rsquo;t want to see us. Philip&rsquo;s insurance
money is all gone. We used the last of it coming
here. I&rsquo;ll have to go to work, I guess, and put the
children in a foster home. I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;d
consider letting them stay on here with you? I&rsquo;d
pay you out of my wages. Maybe I could wait on
tables or find work in a store. Do you mind looking
after the children if I begin hunting for something
tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Judy replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judy, you&rsquo;re kind and thoughtful and understanding&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; Judy stopped her. &ldquo;Peter calls me Angel,
and the next thing, you&rsquo;ll be doing it. I have a
lot of faults. I lose my temper and expect too much
of people and make hasty judgments, and sometimes
I&rsquo;m rude. I was annoyed with you for not
telling the truth&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And well you should have been,&rdquo; Helen Riker
said. &ldquo;For a girl who was once called Sita, I have
fallen far short of the Hindu ideal of perfect
womanhood. Perhaps I was fooled by Ravana, the
evil one. I should have called, &lsquo;Rama! Rama! Rama!&rsquo;
more often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he would have answered you?&rdquo;
asked Judy, still a little baffled by the mystic tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Helen replied, &ldquo;but I waited too long.
Life does not wait for indecision, Judy. As the
demon said in the story, &lsquo;It is too late!&rsquo; Each of his
many heads, pierced by Rama&rsquo;s arrows, cried it to
heaven until there was only one left to speak and it
spoke wisely, &lsquo;Learn by my example. Do selfless
deeds at once. Those that are selfish put them off
till they cease to trouble thy mind.&rsquo; But, you see, I
put off the deeds I should have done. I intended to
visit Uncle Paul and give him back his precious
Sita and tell him how Philip took it for me when
we were both children and didn&rsquo;t know its value.
I dreaded going there and it was even worse than I
imagined. I don&rsquo;t ever want to go again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I do,&rdquo; declared Judy, &ldquo;more than ever
now that you&rsquo;ve told me. Peter!&rdquo; she called.
&ldquo;Where was it you said we were going?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br />More Revelations</h2>
<p>Peter had been in the next room making plans
with the children. Judy knew, even before she
asked him, that they were going to explore the
ruins of the Riker mansion. It did surprise her,
though, when he said the magician was going with
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For goodness sake, why?&rdquo; she wanted to know.
&ldquo;Does he think he can wave his wand over it and
make it rise up out of the ashes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter just grinned in that impish way Judy
loved. He had found out something important, but
so had she.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can hardly wait to tell you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but
first you must tell me. Are we really on the trail of
the real green doll? It <i>was</i> Sita. I&rsquo;m sure of it now.
And more than ever I want to bring Rama and Sita
together. It may not be bad luck to separate two
statues, but it surely is to separate two people who
love each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you mean,&rdquo; Peter said. &ldquo;I heard
you and Helen Riker talking. She&rsquo;s told you something
important. I can see it in your eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Peter, she has.&rdquo; Judy was still too filled
with the hypnotic story of Rama and Sita to tell
Peter much about it, but she did say, &ldquo;She told me
Philip and Paul Riker were twins and that she loved
them both. It was Philip who took the statue of
Sita and gave it to her. She knew it was stolen, but
it was hard for her to gather up enough courage to
bring it back. She was afraid of old Mr. Riker, and
no wonder! Now she thinks he was hiding in a cave
under the vault on purpose to scare people. She&rsquo;s
afraid of meeting him or anyone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have to meet the magician,&rdquo; Peter broke
in. &ldquo;I told you he is going with us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; Helen Riker said, coming
into the room just then, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not go. Why
don&rsquo;t you take the children and let them explore?
I&rsquo;d rather stay here and rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could do that. What do you say, Angel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean me?&rdquo; Judy asked.</p>
<p>She had been off on a flight of fancy. If Peter
could have known her thoughts he might have
called her Cupid instead of Angel. &ldquo;If we could
only find Paul Riker and patch up the old romance,&rdquo;
she was thinking. Aloud, she said to Peter,
&ldquo;There must be some way of finding out what we
want to know without resorting to magic. I&rsquo;m not
at all sure I approve of inviting the magician to go
with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny and Paul approve, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their approval was almost too enthusiastic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can do anything,&rdquo; Penny insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to tell them this magician, whoever
he is, can&rsquo;t work miracles,&rdquo; their mother said a little
impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he can,&rdquo; Peter replied, his eyes twinkling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t like this sudden power he has
over the children,&rdquo; Mrs. Riker said. &ldquo;Why did you
go there, Paul? Tell me the truth, now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;I had to, Mom,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I wanted him to
pick Penny for the magic show. We&rsquo;re going to
join the club and wear black spots on our foreheads&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s the sign of the Destroyer,&rdquo; Judy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know,&rdquo; Paul said, &ldquo;and it was the Destroyer
on Uncle Paul&rsquo;s tomb. Are we going back there?
When are we going to start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right now,&rdquo; Peter told them, &ldquo;with your mother&rsquo;s
permission, of course. Better wrap up good and
warm. It&rsquo;s going to be a cold climb up those steps
to the vault. The cave underneath, if we can find it,
may be even colder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Blackberry going?&rdquo; Paul wanted to know,
when they were ready to start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks that way,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;Judy has him
in the car. He&rsquo;s waiting for you on top of the back
seat. Come along now, and keep him company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy felt a little uneasy about leaving Mrs. Riker
by herself, and telephoned her mother before she
left. Mrs. Bolton agreed to come over and meet her
and keep her company while the doctor went out
on his calls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it all right if Horace and Honey come along
with me?&rdquo; Judy&rsquo;s mother asked. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re here
now. We all went to church together.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;I went to Sunday school, but only long enough
to listen to one hymn. Mrs. Riker will tell you
about it. That is, if she feels like talking. If she
doesn&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t urge her. She may just want to rest.
We&rsquo;re leaving right now, Mom, and much as I love
him, I don&rsquo;t want Horace with us. We&rsquo;ll give him
another stick full of news. Tell him that and bless
you, Motherkins, for doing a good deed and being
my guardian angel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bolton sounded a little baffled as she hung
up. Judy could hear a protesting noise over the telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mom should be used to me by now,&rdquo; she told
Peter as she climbed in the car beside him. &ldquo;I think
she rather enjoys being mystified. Seriously, though,
I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair to make children believe in
magic. They should be told a little about how stage
tricks are performed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble is,&rdquo; Peter said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know myself
how they&rsquo;re performed, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, giggling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here we are,&rdquo; Peter announced, a little
later, stopping before a rambling ranch house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>It was one of the more expensive homes in the
new suburban development. Judy was surprised to
find the Drans living in such luxury. The boys always
spoke of their parents as if they were in modest
circumstances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the magician Mr. Dran?&rdquo; Judy wondered.</p>
<p>Then the thought came to her that the boys&rsquo;
mother might have married a second time. Before
she could explore this possibility the magician himself
appeared at the door. A moment later he entered
the car like anyone else, without tricks. The
door stuck a little and Peter had to help him open
it. He was not introduced. Judy thought he seemed
a little uncomfortable at first, but the children&rsquo;s enthusiasm
was contagious. Soon he was answering all
sorts of questions.</p>
<p>It developed that he had studied magic in India
and had learned some of the tricks discovered by
ancient Hindu fakirs. He was telling the children
that he could place a living head on a table and make
it talk to them, when Judy interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magic is all right in its place,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but
don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;re carrying things a little too
far? You&rsquo;ve made the children believe you can do
practically anything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is that what they told you? I
must be like the many-headed demon Ravana in the
story. Is that what you think, you young rajah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul grinned as if he liked being called a rajah
and said, &ldquo;Mom knows that story, too. She told it
to me because my name is Paul Riker for my uncle
Paul, not the old uncle that built the tomb, but the
young uncle she used to play with. She didn&rsquo;t tell
Penny about young Uncle Paul, because Penny
can&rsquo;t keep secrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it a secret?&rdquo; the magician asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Mom never told anyone but me. When
you love two people and can only marry one of
them you have to keep it a secret that you still love
the other. Besides, Mom meant to give back the
statue of Sita, because it belonged in the collection.
But now she can&rsquo;t, because those bad men stole it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did she get it? Do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father gave it to her when she was just a
little girl,&rdquo; Paul replied. &ldquo;I can tell it now, because
I heard her telling Judy. I still don&rsquo;t get it, though.
In the story Ravana told Sita he could change himself
into Rama at will. But he wouldn&rsquo;t do it, because
he wanted her to love him for himself. Sita
knew that would mean loving evil instead of good,
and so she kept repeating, &lsquo;Rama! Rama! Rama! I
seek thee within me and my senses are sealed.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know that part,&rdquo; squealed Penny. &ldquo;The name,
Rama, magicked her so she could see no evil, hear
no evil, and speak no evil. We have the three little
monkeys. They aren&rsquo;t green like Sita. They&rsquo;re on a
desk blotter Mommy bought in the ten-cent store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen those three little monkeys on desk
blotters lots of times!&rdquo; exclaimed Judy. &ldquo;Horace
used to have them on his desk. I never knew where
the idea came from, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The magician laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now you know. They were part of the
monkey band who rescued Sita from the demon&rsquo;s
cave. You&rsquo;ve taught us something, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy, turning around, could see a puzzled expression
on the little girl&rsquo;s face as she replied, &ldquo;But
you already knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter had appeared to be concentrating on his
driving, but Judy could tell he was listening with
interest to the conversation that was going on behind
him. When Judy told how the children&rsquo;s
mother remembered playing the story of the
&ldquo;Ramayana,&rdquo; the magician said, in an oddly different
voice, &ldquo;Ask her to write it down just as she remembers
it, please. We may have time to put it on
as an extra attraction.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a wonderful idea!&rdquo; exclaimed Judy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
love to see it. But who will take the parts? Do you
think the children will have time to learn them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A narrator can read them,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but
without the little idols the play may not have much
meaning. We must all look for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There it was again! They were supposed to look
for things in spite of the warning. Judy was determined
to find out the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were warned not to,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Did you
warn us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the magician seemed puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to <i>what</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to look for it. We weren&rsquo;t told what <i>it</i> was
we weren&rsquo;t to look for. The voice came from the
trees,&rdquo; Judy told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trees on your place?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>They had reached their destination, but the conversation
held them as they started walking toward
the ruined mansion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Judy replied. &ldquo;I thought maybe you could
throw your voice or something. Were you ever
there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;The children were talking among themselves
about having a magic show in some barn or
other, but I don&rsquo;t remember throwing my voice for
them. And we were near no barn. Mr. Brown offered
his home for the magic show, because it does
have a large recreation room. I told him I would
need a stage and he promised to build one. Some of
my tricks are rather elaborate. They need props.
But everything is there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it is just an ordinary magic show. Nothing
unusual?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he replied, and Judy was sure he and
Peter exchanged a glance, &ldquo;there will be something
very unusual. Something very unusual indeed!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br />The Statue Commands</h2>
<p>Judy was beginning to understand. But something
was wrong somewhere. She puzzled over it
as they walked on toward the ruined mansion.</p>
<p>When they finally reached it, the scene before
them appeared even more desolate than she remembered
it. The snow that had fallen the day before
was melting fast, so that only patches of it remained
in shady places. There was none left around the
burned house and very little under the blackened
trees. But the vault was covered with it as if the cold
from within had penetrated the cold without.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Penny cried out as they climbed the
steps toward the statue. &ldquo;His face is just like the
face in the magazine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like him,&rdquo; Paul said. &ldquo;Why is he looking
like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s meditating,&rdquo; the magician explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t alive, is he?&rdquo; asked Penny. &ldquo;What does
that&mdash;that big word mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means to think hard about the same thing
over and over the way Sita did when she thought
about Rama. It&rsquo;s a little like wishing. You don&rsquo;t always
get your wishes, but you do feel quiet and
peaceful inside so that outside things don&rsquo;t hurt you
any more. It&rsquo;s hard for a little girl to understand,&rdquo;
the magician continued, &ldquo;but the meditation of
Sita kept all evil from her so that she was returned
to Rama as pure and lovely as when the demon
first snatched her away. It was the magic of her
lover&rsquo;s name that did it. When she called, &lsquo;Rama!
Rama!&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet!&rdquo; a voice commanded.</p>
<p>They all stopped dead still to stare at the concrete
face above them. The lips had not moved. There
had not been a sign of life and yet the voice stopped
them so still that Judy could hear her heart beating.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should have told you we would be protected,&rdquo;
Peter said from behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this is protection,&rdquo; Judy retorted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather
be thrown to the lions. Where did that voice come
from? It even startled Blackberry. There he goes,
up to the top of the statue to explore!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if he will find anything. The voice you
heard was probably that of the chief deputy, and
I believe it came from inside the vault. He and his
rangers are determined to find out who set that fire,
if it was set, and how it happened that the mansion
was so conveniently emptied just before the blaze.
I knew they&rsquo;d be there,&rdquo; Peter explained. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
on the lookout for the thieves&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you said there weren&rsquo;t any thieves,&rdquo; Judy
reminded him.</p>
<p>Again the magician and Peter exchanged glances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That remains to be seen. Anyway, the magician
believes something strange is going on here, and he
is in a position to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How <i>can</i> he know?&rdquo; gasped Judy, and added,
laughing, &ldquo;Has he mystical knowledge from the
mysterious East?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>But Peter was serious when he said, &ldquo;Our plans
went wrong somewhere. They may have been too
obvious. At any rate, we know the police are somewhere
in the vicinity. It should be perfectly safe to
explore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think this mystical knowledge of yours
will help us find the cave?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m like
Blackberry. I prefer to look in high places. I think
I&rsquo;ll climb up on top of the vault and see what&rsquo;s
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackberry sure looks as if he&rsquo;s trying to show
you something,&rdquo; agreed Peter. &ldquo;Be careful, though.
It may be slippery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy was halfway up when she thought she
heard a noise from the statue. It sounded like
<i>breathing</i>. Then suddenly it sneezed!</p>
<p>Startled, Judy lost her footing. She grabbed for
one of the bushes growing on top of the vault,
missed it, and began to slide. A moment later she
landed, dazed but unhurt, in the ivy where the others
were searching.</p>
<p>They were all pulling away ivy leaves like so
many excited terriers looking for a bone. By the
time Judy realized what they were doing, Peter,
with the help of the magician, had turned back a
flat stone which looked suspiciously like a tombstone.
On it was chiseled a mysterious sign.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the sign of Om,&rdquo; the magician was explaining.
&ldquo;In India it stands for the highest form of
mysticism. He may have used it as a marker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;The statue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul glanced up at it, but none of the others paid
the slightest attention to what Judy was saying.
They were busy removing the stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This must be the entrance to the cave,&rdquo; declared
Peter. &ldquo;It was completely covered with ivy. We
never would have found it if Judy&rsquo;s shoe hadn&rsquo;t
scraped against it when she fell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were determined to find it, with or without
me,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t anybody going to ask me if
I hurt myself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently nobody was. The rough-hewn steps
they had discovered descending to what looked like
a hole in the ground looked anything but inviting.
But they caught everyone in their spell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who goes down first?&rdquo; the magician asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me&mdash;&rdquo; Judy began eagerly.</p>
<p>But Peter was saying, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d better. Nobody
knows what we may find at the bottom. I&rsquo;ll
give the signal as soon as I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s safe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>It looked as if he were descending into a bottomless
pit. The flashlight he held sent a weird circle
of light ahead of him. It flickered and danced in an
eerie fashion as he waved it and called out, &ldquo;Come
ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy, followed by the magician, Penny, and
Paul, had descended no more than a few steps when
a voice from the statue roared, &ldquo;Stop where you
are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy stopped. It was bad enough to have a statue
sneeze at her. But to hear it roar out a command was
a little too much. She stood frozen. Then she called
down to Peter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter, come back! I&rsquo;m afraid to move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was part way down the steps, but could not
decide whether to go up or down. Either way held
terrors for her now.</p>
<p>Penny and Paul were both hiding their faces in
the magician&rsquo;s coat. His own face was noticeably
whiter. But he kept on a downward course.</p>
<p>Peter was very far down now. Judy suspected
her voice had not carried to him. He called back,
&ldquo;The jade collection is here! It is inside some sort
of cabinet. It&rsquo;s locked, but you can see through
the glass doors. Come on down! It&rsquo;s quite a sight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/img006.jpg" alt="&ldquo;The jade collection is here,&rdquo; Peter called" width="500" height="775" />
<p class="center">&ldquo;The jade collection is here,&rdquo; Peter called</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>Peter seemed so certain it was safe that Judy
obeyed. The children, big-eyed with wonder, held
onto the magician&rsquo;s coat to steady themselves as
they descended. Step after step they went, down,
down, down!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we to the center of the earth yet?&rdquo; Penny
finally asked.</p>
<p>Judy&rsquo;s laugh sent back a strange echo. From the
direction the steps had taken she judged they must
be directly under the vault.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve reached the bottom,&rdquo; she told the children.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. Peter is here. Didn&rsquo;t you hear me?&rdquo;
she asked him. &ldquo;What did you mean when you said
we were protected? If that was the chief deputy
or one of his forest rangers up there, why did he tell
us to stop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may have mistaken us for the thieves,&rdquo; replied
Peter, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t worry about it. We&rsquo;ve arranged
a signal. One shot from my gun and he&rsquo;ll
come running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may need to fire that shot,&rdquo; declared the
magician. &ldquo;That voice was no forest ranger. I&rsquo;d
know it anywhere. It was the voice of Paul Riker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; cried little Paul. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you didn&rsquo;t, little rajah. It was your
old uncle Paul, my boy. But don&rsquo;t be scared. We&rsquo;ll
have a look at his jade collection anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s right here,&rdquo; Peter told him, turning his
flashlight on a cabinet which appeared to be nothing
more than one of the sections of a sectional
bookcase. It was of mahogany badly in need of
polishing. The glass could stand cleaning, too. But
behind it Judy could see the elaborately carved
little figures of many of the gods and goddesses that
had been pictured in the magazine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to believe, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked the magician.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure is,&rdquo; agreed Peter. &ldquo;A quarter of a million
dollars worth of jade buried under an old vault with
nothing but a thin piece of glass for protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Judy, unable to understand the
millionaire&rsquo;s motives. &ldquo;What good are they down
here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c21"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXI</span>
<br />Under the Vault</h2>
<p>The magician&rsquo;s reply was startling, to say the
least.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are no good here to the living,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;and I doubt if they will do Paul Riker much
good after he&rsquo;s dead. But he&rsquo;s determined to keep
what is his. He would rather burn or bury anything
than share it. I know him. Yes, I was the one who
had the contents of his house removed. I saw that
the forest fire was burning in this direction, and so
I hired men to remove his treasures and put them
in storage. Call it robbery if you like, but no one
knew where he was, and how else could I save
them? I noticed the jade collection was not in the
house, and decided he must have hidden it somewhere
before he went away. And here it is. Do you
see that little figure there with the elephant&rsquo;s head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it!&rdquo; cried Paul, standing on tiptoe. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
my favorite next to Rama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know his name, son? That&rsquo;s Ganesha,
the Remover of Obstacles. We&rsquo;re going to need that
little fellow to remove some of the obstacles your
uncle Paul is up against. But never forget this. He
put those obstacles in his own way. His relatives
were welcome here only when he could bend them
to his will. It angered him when his nephews refused
to follow the Riker tradition and deal in
tombstones. They preferred to raise monuments to
the living. You two children are a monument to
your father, and to your old uncle, too, if only he
had the eyes to see it. But no! Everything had to be
quiet. He had no use for a business like mine that
provides fun and entertainment. Finally he became
suspicious of everyone. He&rsquo;s become a bitter, cruel
old man. And yet in a way I loved him. Poor Uncle
Paul!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>They stood there under the vault as if Paul Riker
were already dead, mourning for him. But suddenly
Peter sprang into action. He vaulted up the stairs,
taking them three at a time. He was just too late.
Judy heard a crash of stone falling against stone.
They were imprisoned under the vault!</p>
<p>A shot rang out. Then another and another!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; cried Judy. &ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he called back in a voice of confidence.
&ldquo;You can trust the forest rangers to get us
out of here if we can&rsquo;t find a way out by ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the children&rsquo;s mother had come with us she
might have been able to help us,&rdquo; Judy told the
magician. &ldquo;She says she used to play here with the
Riker twins, Philip and Paul. Their uncle chased
them out and took possession of the cave. I should
have asked her if there&rsquo;s more than one entrance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were two,&rdquo; was the startling reply. &ldquo;One
was the cave of Ravana. Rama would stand at the
other entrance calling, &lsquo;O my Sita! Do not give up
hope. I will send my faithful Hanumen, king of the
monkeys, with a ring for thy finger.&rsquo; The ring,&rdquo;
the magician explained in his ordinary voice, &ldquo;stands
for the magic circle of love that never ends, like the
love of Rama and Sita.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;You know the story as well as Helen does,&rdquo;
Judy said quietly, smiling. &ldquo;You called Mr. Riker
Uncle Paul and you knew about the cave. You
<i>must</i> be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the time being, call me Rama,&rdquo; he interrupted
before she could say what she felt sure now
must be his name. &ldquo;I hope I may be the true Rama
and that Sita will accept my ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Judy really felt like Cupid, but she
still hadn&rsquo;t brought the two lovers together. Their
predicament took her quickly back to reality. The
other entrance to the cave proved to be effectively
blocked by an iron door evidently bolted on the
outside. After several useless attempts to open it,
Peter fired a few more signal shots and then announced
that there was nothing to do but wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing we found the jade collection
before the thieves did,&rdquo; he said to the magician. &ldquo;I
doubt if your uncle could have stopped them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t have. I&rsquo;d like to see the whole collection
placed in a museum where it would be safe
and other people could enjoy it and learn the legends
about the different gods and goddesses.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know a lot of them,&rdquo; announced Paul. &ldquo;Mom
used to tell them to me before Penny began asking
so many questions. Maybe Ganesha, the Remover
of Obstacles, will remove the stone from over the
door. I don&rsquo;t like being shut down here. Is it all
right if I ask him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter started to protest, but the magician said,
&ldquo;Let him pretend if he wants to. It will keep him
from being frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lift me up!&rdquo; Penny pleaded. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy smiled as she saw the magician lift her and
hold her close. She was thinking what a good father
he would make. Impulsively she asked, &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t
married, are you? I thought at first you were Mr.
Dran. I know you live with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All four of them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Dran
and the two children. They keep my house in order
and make it more like a home. Their boys are smart
little fellows, but they can&rsquo;t beat these two. Paul,
here, knows the names of these pieces almost as well
as I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was pointing them out, one after another, to
the children. Not all of them were green. The
monkey god was carved out of mottled gray jade,
and Ravana, with his many heads, was almost black.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>All the idols were small and delicately carved.
The largest was the four-headed Brahma, the Creator,
sitting on his throne in the center. The Preserver
of Life, Vishnu, and the Destroyer, Shiva,
were placed on his right and his left. The other
jade pieces were variously grouped around them.</p>
<p>Peter pointed out the life god or the Preserver,
and his wife, a tiny image. Penny said she looked
almost like Sita.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is Rama?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in good hands, thanks to Judy and Peter,&rdquo;
the magician assured both children. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s waiting
for Sita just as I am. When you see him I hope
they will be together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will be,&rdquo; Peter said with quiet confidence.</p>
<p>Now little Paul was curious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did Rama look like?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>He was told that Rama was a green image and
carried a sheaf of arrows at his belt. He had been
carved in the act of bending a great bow in order
to win the hand of Sita.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What bow shall I bend?&rdquo; asked the magician.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re already bending it,&rdquo; Judy told
him, &ldquo;in winning the hearts of the children. Do
they know who you are?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>She asked this last question in almost a whisper.
The children had moved away from them a little
and were busy talking to each other about the contents
of the case. Peter had let them take his flashlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to say what they know,&rdquo; the magician
said in answer to her whispered question. &ldquo;I think
Paul suspects more than he will admit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Penny? Does she know?&rdquo; Judy
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she does,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;She keeps
staring at me with those big blue eyes of hers as if
she expects me to vanish any minute. She&rsquo;s such a
little pretender that it&rsquo;s hard to guess what she&rsquo;s
thinking. Neither of them has called me Uncle
Paul. You knew it, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a while,&rdquo; Judy said, relieved that he had
admitted it. &ldquo;Naturally, it explains a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a lot it didn&rsquo;t explain, though. Judy
was about to question him further when, suddenly,
a light fell across the cabinet, and she heard Peter
calling her from above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The entrance must be clear,&rdquo; she told the children.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s follow the magician up the steps and
see what&rsquo;s happening above.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angry words came down to her. An old man&rsquo;s
voice was raised above the others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;So you did come back, you thieving rascal! I
knew you would! But that jade collection is mine,
I tell you! And I mean to keep it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c22"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXII</span>
<br />Blackberry&rsquo;s Discovery</h2>
<p>When Judy and the children reached the top of
the steps leading up from the cave, they found a
straight, tall, thin old man standing between the
two forest rangers who had heard Peter&rsquo;s signal
and freed them from the cave. Without a doubt,
the old man was Paul Riker, and he was shaking his
finger angrily at the magician.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a thief just like your brother,&rdquo; the enraged
voice of the old man continued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the
law on you! It was <i>you</i> who robbed my house, and
now you&rsquo;re trying&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;I only moved your things to keep them from
being destroyed, Uncle Paul,&rdquo; the magician declared.
&ldquo;But the men I trusted have tricked me.
They found out that your famous jade collection
was missing when they moved your other things,
and they have been searching for it ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; the old man demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what he means,&rdquo; Peter put in.
&ldquo;Three of the moving men he hired turned out not
to be so trustworthy. They found a letter from
your niece saying she was returning a piece that belonged
in your jade collection. Since the collection
was not moved to the warehouse, they thought it
must still be in your house. They returned to the
house after the police had left, and searched it.&rdquo;
Peter hesitated. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my theory,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that
they set fire to the house either on purpose or accidentally.
However, you will have to convince the
insurance people that you did not do it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set fire to my own house!&rdquo; The old man roared
with rage. &ldquo;What kind of idiots am I dealing with?
I simply closed the house and took a room in a place
a few miles from here. And do you know why I
did that? Because I had no wish to see that ungrateful
girl nor the children of that scamp, Philip!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you came back and watched what was going
on,&rdquo; Peter reminded him. &ldquo;You were in the
cave when my wife came here yesterday, and you
are here again today. You went out the other exit
from the cave as we came down the steps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; the old man snapped. &ldquo;It is my
property, every inch of it, and I intended to guard
it. Somebody had to,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;That idiot, Abner
Post, went away Thursday night and let this thieving
rascal walk off with practically everything in
my house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you, Uncle Paul,&rdquo; the younger Paul Riker
said wearily, &ldquo;I saw that your house was in the path
of the fire and wanted to save your things. I came
to the caretaker&rsquo;s cottage, but it was locked and he
was away. The big house was closed too. So I called
up the moving company, gave them my name, and
had them take your most valuable things to the
warehouse. What else could I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky for you, Mr. Riker, that he did,&rdquo;
Peter said, &ldquo;The fire would have reached your
house eventually. Then you would have lost everything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>The old man cackled suddenly. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have
lost my jade collection,&rdquo; he declared. Then his face
darkened. &ldquo;But there are two pieces missing now.
And without Rama and Sita it&rsquo;s hardly a collection
at all. My thieving nephews robbed me of Sita years
ago, and now somebody&rsquo;s stolen Rama from inside
the vault where I intended to keep the whole collection.
I gave orders to have it buried with me, but
who can I trust to carry out my orders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy wanted to tell him Rama was safe, but a
warning look from Peter stopped her. As the
millionaire raved on she began to understand the
warped reasoning that had cheated him out of
all the things she felt enriched a life. He seemed
to care more for his memorial in stone than for
the living memory he could leave with those who
would love him if he would only let them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember, Uncle Paul, how you used
to accuse me of stealing Sita?&rdquo; the magician was
saying. &ldquo;Well, I can tell you now, because, for the
first time, I know what happened to her. Philip
took her to give to Helen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in all these years she&rsquo;s never returned it!&rdquo;
the old man exploded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;But Uncle, it was your own fault,&rdquo; the magician
pointed out. &ldquo;You drove them both out and made
them afraid of you. And Helen was on her way to
return it to you. The thieves knew from her letter
when she was arriving. They were on the lookout
for her and tried to force her to tell them where the
rest of the collection was. Can&rsquo;t you see what they
were planning? Be sensible, Uncle Paul, and let us
put it in a museum where it will be under guard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; roared Uncle Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we will have to place it under guard
while you are being questioned,&rdquo; Peter said quietly.
&ldquo;I hate to have to say this, Mr. Riker, but your
house was not burned by the forest fire, and you will
have to satisfy the insurance company as well as our
office that you had nothing to do with either of the
fires. The law says arson on state forest land is a federal
offence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Riker protested vehemently. Nevertheless,
when the chief deputy of the rangers drove his car
up to the vault, the old man got in with surprising
meekness. Judy suspected that the excitement had
tired him out in spite of his rambunctious spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to go with Mr. Riker, Angel,&rdquo; Peter
said. &ldquo;Do you mind driving home, or would you
rather wait here for me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind driving a bit,&rdquo; Judy replied. &ldquo;But
before we start, I want to find out why the statue
seemed to talk. It&rsquo;s solid cement. Nobody could
possibly get inside it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Peter, &ldquo;but there are hollow pipes
running through it. They were probably placed
there to keep the cement from cracking. Old Paul
Riker, down in the cave, must have shouted
through them in order to scare people away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hollow pipes,&rdquo; Judy said thoughtfully. &ldquo;Peter,
do you think the tree talked the same way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Horace told me <i>he</i> heard
it say, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re starved!&rsquo; just before you and the kids
dashed in from the barn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it carried our voices from the hayloft!
But who was up there, calling, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t look for it!&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter shook his head. He had no answer for that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more question, Peter, please,&rdquo; Judy begged.
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell Mr. Riker we had found his
jade Rama? Were you trying to protect me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You saw how
vehemently he accused his nephew. He wouldn&rsquo;t
have believed you were trying to help him. When
we find Sita we&rsquo;ll give him both pieces and his collection
will be complete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how will you find her?&rdquo; asked Judy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;By finding the thieves. In the meantime,&rdquo; Peter
said, &ldquo;we intend to see to it that they don&rsquo;t find the
rest of the collection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two of the rangers went down the steps into the
cave and brought up the cabinet containing the
jade. They put it in the car with old Mr. Riker,
Peter got in, and off they went.</p>
<p>Young Paul Riker stood watching the car disappear
down the road, as Judy loaded the two children
and Blackberry into Peter&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Uncle Paul,&rdquo; he sighed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c23"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIII</span>
<br />Stage Magic</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing must keep your mother from attending
the magic show with us,&rdquo; Judy told the children
when they reached home.</p>
<p>Little else was said about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A secret is more fun,&rdquo; Penny whispered. Both
children knew now that the magician was their
young uncle Paul.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>There were so many secrets that Judy was afraid
the children&rsquo;s mother would suspect their plans.
But she was too busy with plans of her own to pay
much attention to them. The very next day she
found employment in the Roulsville variety store
and declared that she would soon repay Judy and
Peter for all their kindnesses.</p>
<p>On the same day, which was Monday, Penny
and Paul started in school, taking the bus at the
main road and attending the school where Judy
once went.</p>
<p>Wednesday finally came, the day of the magic
show. Since there was no school the next day,
Thursday being Thanksgiving, the children could
stay up a little later in the evening. Penny was all
excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just wait, Mommy!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see
I&rsquo;m not making it up. The magician can even make
wishes come true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wear your prettiest dress, Mom,&rdquo; Paul suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she agreed, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t want to
meet this magician. You know how I feel about
strangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy did not tell her the magician was no
stranger.</p>
<p>Judy and Peter arrived with Horace and Honey
to find the Browns&rsquo; recreation room already
crowded. Rows and rows of chairs were lined up
before the stage. The front row was reserved for
the club members. Penny and Paul joined them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s room for you, too,&rdquo; Ricky whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Judy whispered back.</p>
<p>They were all seated before she realized Helen
Riker was not with them. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your mother?&rdquo;
she whispered across to Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s back there somewhere,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Her
face got awfully white when she saw him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy knew Paul meant the magician.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; she began uncertainly, &ldquo;as
long as she can&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was interrupted by the sound of clapping
hands. The heavy velvet curtain had parted. The
magician appeared on the stage smiling and bowing.
He had a wand in his hand. As he waved it, flags of
all nations began to appear. When the stage was
quite filled with them he waved the wand again
and every flag vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is stage magic,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Watch
carefully and you may discover my secrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After he had done a few more astounding feats
with ropes, balls, and boxes, he asked, &ldquo;Did anyone
in the audience wish for a canary bird?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did!&rdquo; cried Paul, jumping to his feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will you step up on the stage for a moment?&rdquo;
asked the magician. &ldquo;Birds come from eggs, do
they not? May I take your handkerchief? I hope
you don&rsquo;t mind what happens to it,&rdquo; he continued
as he began rolling it into a ball. Soon the handkerchief
was gone and in its place was a round,
white egg!</p>
<p>&ldquo;My handkerchief!&rdquo; gasped Paul.</p>
<p>Judy could see that this trick had not been rehearsed.
She was as surprised as the children were
when little Paul reached in his pocket, at the magician&rsquo;s
suggestion, and pulled out a real live canary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will I put him?&rdquo; asked Paul as he held
the fluttering bird.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about a cage?&rdquo; asked his amazing young
uncle. Touching the table in front of him with his
wand, he made a cage appear out of nothing. Another
flick of his magic wand and it disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;As a rule
magicians don&rsquo;t explain their tricks, but this is going
to be an exception. You&rsquo;ve seen a magnet attract
a pin or a needle. Well, the magnet on the end of
the wand attracts the spring that collapses or unfolds
the cage, and presto!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cage reappeared on the table, and Paul let
the bird fly into it. There was a thunder of applause
followed by the announcement that a girl could be
made to vanish as easily as a birdcage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me!&rdquo; cried Penny, running up on the stage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c24"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIV</span>
<br />Real Magic</h2>
<p>Judy was glad when Helen Riker slipped into
the seat Penny had left. She was just in time to hear
the magician&rsquo;s announcement that it would be real
magic if he could make all the children&rsquo;s wishes
come true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny has wished for her father and now she
sees a man exactly like him. Is that right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; Penny said. &ldquo;I closed my eyes, and
when I opened them there was my daddy again&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see?&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m not her real
daddy, I must be his twin brother. At any rate, the
little lady trusts me. Now watch as I make her
disappear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny climbed up on the long table in front of
the magician and waved good-bye to the audience.
Her mother was watching as if she really expected
a miracle. Turning to Judy, she said, &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t
going to use a screen. I&rsquo;ve seen this trick before, but
Paul would be different. He <i>is</i> like Philip&mdash;so like
him it&rsquo;s almost uncanny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; cried Judy, but nobody heard
her because at the same time exclamations of surprise
went up from everyone else in the audience.
The table top was empty. The magician had made
the little girl vanish right before their eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;was a trick which
Penny herself will explain to you as soon as I bring
her back. I have to say a few magic words first.
They may be familiar to someone in the audience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he began to chant, &ldquo;Rama! Rama! Sita!
Rama! Arise, daughter of Sita as lovely as a rose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holding his wand over a large, empty vase that
stood on the table, he continued to chant mystic
phrases as first a bouquet of roses and then Penny
herself came up, smiling through the roses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A real girl and real roses!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;And a real daddy,&rdquo; she chirped. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that real
magic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clapping hands answered her as the magician began
throwing the roses. Helen Riker caught one,
and held it in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will make up for everything I lost, unless&mdash;Judy!&rdquo;
she asked suddenly. &ldquo;Who were those boys
who came in with him? I saw them together in the
store, too. He&rsquo;s not married, is he? I couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy told her the Dran family were only caretakers
for young Uncle Paul as her family had been
caretakers for old Uncle Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he likes children around him,&rdquo; Judy
finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see that. Oh, I&rsquo;m so happy. We don&rsquo;t need
those little idols, Judy. We&rsquo;re going to have each
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, Mommy!&rdquo; Penny announced, returning to
her chair and cuddling into her mother&rsquo;s lap.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you he could make wishes come
true?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>Soon after that, the curtain was drawn and the
magician did not appear again in spite of all the
clapping. Now the club members gathered around
Penny. She began to explain in a mysterious voice
just the way she had rehearsed the disappearing
trick. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a hiding place under the stage. You
remember how thick the table top was? Well,
there&rsquo;s a sliding panel of thin wood&mdash;see! And
when the panel slid out from under me, I dropped
right into the table and disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get inside the vase?&rdquo; several
voices questioned.</p>
<p>Penny laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was easy. I slid through the table leg. It
was hollow and went down like a tunnel under
the stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was there,&rdquo; Wally spoke up proudly. &ldquo;I
pushed up Penny and the roses through the table
and through the bottom of the vase. It was a neat
trick. I only wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; everybody asked when he paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish my father&rsquo;s pocketknife would turn up
like Penny did,&rdquo; he said ruefully. &ldquo;Pop&rsquo;s mad at
me. I borrowed it to play with, and dropped it in
the hay in your barn, Judy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did?&rdquo; Judy asked. &ldquo;When was this?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;Saturday morning,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I was going to
look for it, but Ricky chased me out of there. We&rsquo;d
had a fight. He said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t look for it!&rsquo; I was going
to come back and hunt around later, but he kept
chasing me out, and yelling, &lsquo;Run!&rsquo; and I was
scared. He can throw knives, that Ricky! He&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; Judy stopped him. &ldquo;He has a
knife, but have you ever seen him throw it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-no,&rdquo; Wally admitted. &ldquo;He can throw a lasso,
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know that.&rdquo; Judy smiled at Peter, and from
the way he smiled back she knew that he too had
guessed the solution of the mystery of the talking
tree. It had been Ricky&rsquo;s voice all the time, but he
hadn&rsquo;t even known it himself.</p>
<p>The curtain suddenly parted and there stood
Helen Riker and the magician on the stage together.</p>
<p>Running up on the stage, Judy whispered something
to the magician and then turned to the audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weather permitting,&rdquo; she announced, &ldquo;a play
will be given in our grove the day after Thanksgiving.
I hope you will all be there to see it. The
magician will direct it. I can&rsquo;t promise for certain,
but I believe he will accomplish the amazing feat of
making a tree talk.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>She had no dinner to prepare the following day,
as there would be a family gathering around her
parents&rsquo; table. The Rikers were invited but politely
refused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be having our own Thanksgiving at
Paul&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; Helen Riker said, and added impulsively,
&ldquo;Oh, Judy! Aren&rsquo;t you happy for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly am,&rdquo; Judy said warmly, and meant it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rama has rescued me,&rdquo; Helen said, &ldquo;as he rescued
Sita in the &lsquo;Ramayana.&rsquo; Friday you shall see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy did see it. The story was all that she had
hoped it would be&mdash;and more. Old Uncle Paul was
there to watch it. He had been cleared of the charge
of arson when Peter and the police caught the three
men who had stolen Sita from Helen. The thieves
also admitted having set fire to the house by accident
when they went back to search for the jade.</p>
<p>The magician, taking the part of Rama, was also
the narrator. Evil, according to the ancient story,
reigned supreme until the god of life, Vishnu, and
his wife were born as Rama and Sita. Prince and
princess, they were fated to meet and marry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>Helen Riker, in a green dress, was beautiful as
Sita. The children took the parts of the monkeys
who rescued her, but the strangest character in the
whole play was the demon Ravana. The part of the
many-headed monster was taken by the talking
tree! When Sita was kidnaped, she sat in its lower
branches chanting her mystic &ldquo;Rama! Rama!
Rama! I seek thee within me and my senses are
sealed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the rescue, the magician, as Rama, was
supposed to slay the monster and restore the powers
of virtue to the earth. Each time he pierced the
tree with his arrow, Judy, hiding in the barn to be
the voice of Ravana, called out, &ldquo;Too late!&rdquo; But the
last time she spoke the ancient words of wisdom,
&ldquo;Learn by my example! Do selfless deeds at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And almost at once she was back in the grove
presenting old Uncle Paul with his two precious
jade statues. He took them both, fondled them a
moment and then, with tear-moist eyes, said, &ldquo;They
complete the Riker collection. Put it in the museum,
Paul. Let other people look at it. Let them
learn by my example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; Judy told Peter later, &ldquo;have I felt so
sorry for anyone. He&rsquo;s an old man and an unhappy
man in spite of his wealth. He can&rsquo;t have very many
more years to live.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;Be thankful,&rdquo; Peter said, &ldquo;that he has lived long
enough to do this one generous act. People will
remember him for his jade collection long after
they have forgotten even his monument. Someone&mdash;if
I were Horace I could quote him exactly&mdash;said,
&lsquo;The best thing to do with a life is to spend it
for something which outlasts it.&rsquo; And whether he
intended it that way or not, that&rsquo;s what Paul Riker
has done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Judy whispered. &ldquo;Does love outlast it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s answer was a kiss. They both knew it did.
They were quiet, sharing a wonderful moment
together. Then Peter broke the spell by suggesting
that Judy go with him to the barn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honey&rsquo;s still here. We must show her how the
tree talked if Horace hasn&rsquo;t already told her. It
works just like the pipes in that statue, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After much persuasion, Honey consented to
stand beside the hollow tree while they showed her
how it had all happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be scared,&rdquo; Judy told her. &ldquo;We may
sound a little spooky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>When they had climbed to the hayloft they
stood directly under the little window that looked
out over the grove. The hollow branch just outside
it acted like a speaking tube and carried their voices
out through the hole in the tree as they chanted:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;re standing beside the talking tree,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>But the voices you hear are Peter and me-ee!</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Judy knew how hollow their voices must sound
to Honey. A moment later she was racing toward
the barn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; she charged. &ldquo;You two spooks can
haunt the grove whenever you want to by hiding
in the hayloft and talking out that little window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now she was convinced that the superstition had
started when someone in the barn had accidentally
frightened Horace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s so silly,&rdquo; she said fondly, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t help
loving him for it. And isn&rsquo;t it wonderful how things
have turned out for Mrs. Riker and the magician?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is,&rdquo; agreed Judy. &ldquo;He gave her a
ring just the way Rama did in the story. But, best
of all, the collection is saved for future Ramas and
Sitas. It&rsquo;s nice to know what&rsquo;s expected of the ideal
man and woman, isn&rsquo;t it? Peter,&rdquo; she asked abruptly,
&ldquo;am I your ideal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re my Judy,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s even
better. What was it you said about every day beginning
a new mystery?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the way I feel about life,&rdquo; Judy explained to
Honey. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my philosophy, my Judyana, or whatever
you want to call it. Go down to the grove and
the talking tree will tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; Honey said with a laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been meditating the matter, and my Honeyana
tells me I&rsquo;ve had enough. The next time I letter
a sign, Judy, it will be for Dean Studios, not for
anyone like you.&rdquo;</p>
